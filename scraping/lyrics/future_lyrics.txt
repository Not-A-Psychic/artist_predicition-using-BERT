Pussy niggas told, ain't gon' wake up out they sleep

That's that shit'll get you put up out the section, brrt
And the motto still the same

You know these hoes hungry, they gon' fuck for a name
I put her on the gang, she get fucked for a chain
Got your girl in this bitch, she twirlin' on the dick
I got syrup in this bitch, turn up in this bitch
And we brought the 'Ercs in this bitch, get murked in this bitch
All these pointers on me, baby, you know it's game time
Bring a friend, bitch, we fucked 'em at the same time

Hundred thousands, I just cashed out on designer
Gotta devour, nigga, I learned that in the jungle
Once I sell this load, that's a million in a week

Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?

I got the jewels flooded from Ben, baby!
[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, "Boy I think the money's startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, "Watch what they do for the ones"
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man, you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh, yeah
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out..

[Verse 2: Future]
I might end up with your ho if I take one (Still comin')
Now days if they don't have a story, they gon' make one (Still comin')
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one (Still comin')
I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one (Still comin')
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones (Yeah, comin')
'Cause now days if they don't got it they'll make one (Still comin')
The only time I feel alive when I take (Still comin')
I wanna vent but I know it ain't safe (Still comin')
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am? (Do you know who I am?)
Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am? (Never say my name)
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am? (Give you my t-)
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos (No videos)
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (I invented)
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no
[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong (Yeah, comin')

Still comin' out strong

Pluto don't dance, but I make moves (Keep comin')
We fucked around, now a nigga gotta shame you (Keep comin')
Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too (Keep comin')
Told me, "Boy I think the money startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am
You must not know who I am
I pour champagne on the ground
I pour champagne on the ground
My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz (Freebandz)
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' (He was sayin')
You turned your back, I should have never gave you chances (Gave you chances)
I call for loyalty, she didn't ever answer
I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (La familia)
You're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies
(So familiar)
I got Jenny, I got Tammy, I got Sandy
You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded
Be honest to me
[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong (Be honest to me)
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out...

Kindness, she lie
Still comin', lie
Boss, fuck around, boss
Kindness
Down, like a nigga, she lie

I don't wanna hear all that, I don't wanna hear none of that
Talkin' commas, how much you need and all that shit
Fuck that shit, I don't remember none of that shit
[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out
[Verse 1: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, you went and switched sides?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas spread lies on him?
Where your ass was at, dog, when the bodies came sliding?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was serving pies?
[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out
[Verse 2: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? You came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco
12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

[Verse 3: Drake]
Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was "What's the hold up?"
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we're paying back dues
Where were you when all the dogs needed help?
Lawyers and the commissary ain't gon' pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain't got no choice
'Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I'm self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at? Last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders
[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out
[Verse 4: Future]
60 for a walk through, bitch don't panic (Woo, walk, Fu—)
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage (Fall, savage)
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket (Swim, nigga, ha, ha)
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet (Slatt)
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt (Dog, Freeband—)
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was on my come-up? (At, come-up)
The reason I'm here today 'cause I ain't never gave up

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out
[Outro: Future]
Where you ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

Codeine crazy
Yeah (8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)
Pourin' bubbly, pourin' bubbly
Pour that bubbly, pour that bubbly
Pour that bubbly
We done went through too much, you hear me?
(8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)
[Refrain]
Pour that bubbly
Drink that muddy, drink is muddy when we covered in it
Yeah, I'm covered in it
I was thuggin' it, I was just loving lit
That's for them other niggas, that's for the other bitches
That ain't for you, dawg, that's for them other niggas
That ain't for you, shawty, that's for that other bitch
I'm going crazy 'bout it, I'm going codeine crazy
That's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely
I'm drinking bubbly
I'm drinking bubbly (Yeah)
[Verse 1]
Take all my problems and drink out the bottle and fuck on a model, yeah
Audemars, this not a carnival, this is a Royal Oak Cartier
Dom Pérignon, I get down from a brown, I get chauffeured around
I pour up with my rounds, I flew up out of town
I corrupted your town with them guns and them pounds
I grew up on the grounds with them dealers and hounds
We order more bottles and fuck on more models and pass 'em around
I say everything triple time
Rollie, AP, Hublot, triple time
I just know the ones you call upon
I just had to pay my dawg a bond
Looking at me like a triple threat
Every time a nigga talk, a check
Smoke the kush up like a cigarette
Run it back, you hear my intellect (8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)

[Bridge]
Celebrating like the championship
Celebrating like the championship
Celebrate like the championship
Celebrate like the championship
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you
Hahaha, celebrate
[Verse 2]
Don't tell me you celibate to the mula
I just went Rick the Ruler with the jeweler
I just went St. Tropez-in' like a goonie
Abu Dhabi, nigga straight out the sewer
Like a loaded chopper, I'm 'bout to shoot it
I'm so fucking sick and tired of these rumors
I just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'
Take it back and take a look at yourself
Take the lesson, put it all in the air
Too many days gone by
Sittin' by the phone, waitin' 'til I reply
Drying my eyes, believe it or not
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' on me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another sixty thousand on a Rollie
All my diamonds got you brainwashed
She sucked my dick, it got my brain washed
And for that shit, you got your man popped
See what they did to Biggie and Pac
Pour a lil', lil' liquor out, pour a lil' more liquor out
Pour it out, pour it out, pour it out

[Chorus]
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy
[Verse 3]
Drownin' in Actavis, suicide
When I hit the scene, it's homicide
Diamond pinky ring a lollipop
Fuck the hate, I pull up in a drop
Diamonds colder than a glacier
Ballin' harder than the Pacers
I been tryin' to have some patience
Told my mama she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gon' put a nigga name on it
I just dropped a whole thang on it
I'm making USD's overseas
That's U.S. dollars that you can't achieve
Fucked my white girl, she said, "Nigga, please"
For that white girl, she said, "Nigga, please"
Playin' poker, now we're back in Stroker
I forgot her name but her pussy soakin'
When I seen her on the pole
Reminded myself when I used to come over
Reminded myself when I used to get loaded
Remindin' myself that I'm still gettin' loaded
The coupe fully loaded, this whip fully loaded
This whip fully loaded, the clip fully loaded
I try to control it
Let's wrap up some bottles, let's pop off some bottles, these niggas too bogus
Let's pour up a pint, I'ma fuck around, faint like I'm Kid Cudi, probably
I fuck around, faint, I'ma fall on the drank
Rockin' Tom Ford, poppin' mollies
Married to this motherfuckin' money

[Chorus]
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy
[Verse 4]
You thought I forgot about us?
I know that you know I don't fold under pressure
I'm back on the road, I get low on the pedal
We live by the codes of the ghetto
I'm closing this out with my memo
I'm treating this shit like a demo
I'm putting my heart and my soul in this shit and some more
I'm in that Dolce Gabbana
I might get after Madonna
I get it crack in the summer
Strapped in the 'Lac and the Hummer
Fronted a pack to my partner
All this lingo got her panties to dropping
Fuck the fame, I'm sipping lean when I'm driving
All this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it
I'm an addict and I can't even hide it
Don't you panic, panoramic companion
They was tryna serve me at the arraignment
Never comment on it, never complaining
I'm taking everything that come with these millions
I'm taking everything that come with my children
Yeah, yeah
[Refrain]
Pour that bubbly
Drink that muddy, drink is muddy when we covered in it
Yeah, I'm covered in it
I was thuggin' it, I was just loving lit
That's for them other niggas, that's for the other bitches
That ain't for you, dawg, that's for them other niggas
That ain't for you, shawty, that's for that other bitch
I'm going crazy 'bout it, I'm going codeine crazy
That's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely
I'm drinking bubbly

White girl, Ice T
Fully loaded AP, yeah
[Chorus]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought
[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you
I had to make me a cot
Now I called a contractor to make me a spot
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
Cause there’s too much to hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at, niggas know I ain't lying
Niggas know I ain't lying
It's a lot on my mind, it's a lot on my plate
But I never complain
I was working the weight like I came out the gym
I never did train
Put the girl on a train
Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change, ayy

I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out

I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought
[Verse 2]
I strapped the dope to your spouse
The first time I gave her an ounce
I put some free bands in her account
I told her, "Bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout"
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I’m working on having some manners
I’m thinking about it right now
I’m holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air

I know your true feelings ain't
They couldn't be here, you hear me?
They gotta be somewhere else

[Chorus]
I ain't worryin' 'bout no fucking, I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
Does sexing on the late night mean that much to you?
My love don't mean that much to you
Fucking these hoes meant too damn much to you
I just hope when you fucking on that nigga, when you finished
He can say that he love you
Now do you feel better 'bout yourself?
Do you feel better by yourself?
Did you feel better when I left?
Mark my words, I'ma ball without you
I came home last night to a ménage
Got my dick sucked and I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you
When you fucking on that nigga, hope you thinking about me
When you laying with that nigga, hope you thinking about me
'Cause I'm thinking about you
[Refrain]
Go'n fuck that nigga, get it over with
Go'n fuck that nigga, get it over with
[Verse 2]
I want you to fuck him in paradise
'Cause I wanna be in your head tonight
If loving me in public ain't safe
You can take my love and hide it
Don't give up on me today
Hold on to me like a true love
I told you it was a true love
I ended up with temptations
You goin' out the country
You posting up on IG
I'm laid up with my sidepiece
The one that text while you was right there laying up beside me
Now tell me you don't want me
Tell me that the pussy ain't mines no more
Tell me you moving on and you don't love me no more
Monster

[Chorus]
I ain't worryin' 'bout no fucking, I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
Does sexing on the late night mean that much to you?
My love don't mean that much to you
Fucking these hoes meant too damn much to you
I just hope when you fucking on that nigga, when you finished
He can say that he love you
Now do you feel better 'bout yourself?
Do you feel better by yourself?
Did you feel better when I left?
Mark my words, I'ma ball without you
I came home last night to a ménage
Got my dick sucked and I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you
When you fucking on that nigga, hope you thinking about me
When you laying with that nigga, hope you thinking about me

Walk me off the plank because you know that I'm a swimmer (I won't wait for you)
Supposed to be your dog, but you done put me in a kennel

Tried to bring the best out you, guess I'm not that influential
Guess I'm not the one that's meant for you

They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk
[Chorus]
10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us ‘cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery
[Verse 1]
They came through with a stick and you heard it
They came through in this bitch and they were swerving
I can't believe the blood ain't on my shirt
Because he got hit close-range
We be talking stick talk, we be talking bricks too
We be talking lick talk, and I'ma fuck your bitch too
I ain't got no manners for no sluts
I'ma put my thumb in her butt

I was on the E-way with that molly and that old girl
Get a little cheaper, you could win
Hit it little harder, get the Benz

Whippin' the yam, whippin and flippin' the yam
Turn the whole brick to a Lam
Re-rockin' the dope, soon as it get off the boat
Keepin' it soft like a mink
Gold on my link, coke in the sink
Choppin' that work like karate
Servin' a new Maserati, in a brand new Maserati
That's a whole lot of new money
Snatch it, then hide it from the 12
Movin' them squares and them bales
Servin' the rawest of yayo
Beating that china like Kunta Kinte
Whippin' it, whippin' that fish and Parkay
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze
Made myself a boss, a boss and a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good
Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood
Bakin' soda water splash the scales
Fork in my right and my pot in my left
Leanin' all the way over to the side
I whip me a four way to a nine

Get it, nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever
And flood their Rollie till the bezel break?
Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tails
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YUGHH! Look at the clues
The J's, the jewels, I'm actin' a monkey
From 16 years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies

Me, I try to leave the best for later
But Pusha tried to put me on the respirator
The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite
Me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked
Frequency high, like a spaceship
She say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes
That's Comme des Garçons and the Buffalo
I know guerrillas with the triggers that's on a banana clip
And packin' with the biggest missiles
These niggas is knocking over vehicles
These niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas
These niggas ain't tryna hear plea, niggas
These niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas
These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas
These niggas hit the weed then they lean niggas, gee, nigga
If you got two hoes, you need to let one go
Two Lambos, you need to let one go
All these drones while y'all smoke dro
There's an eye in the sky, I'm tryna let y'all know
Ain't no standards, I'ma set one though
Big ass bag but no man sandals
All that war, we need to let that go
That boom business, I'ma get that ho

Young nigga cashed out
Popped so many Percs, popped so many Xans
Young nigga 'bout to pass out
12 jump behind me, I got some in the car
Young nigga 'bout to smash out
Migo hit that line, say he got some bricks
Young fresh 'bout to buy 'em out
QuikTrip 'round the corner, dropped a nine
Got the J's in the lunch line smokin' iron
Cocaine, cocaine cowboy, like Mickey Munday
Take over the project, whip a line, me no wait

The J's in my hood smoke that crack, say it give 'em hope
Serve a nigga whole brick, he hopin' that it come and go

Ooh (Ooh)
Yeah

Even though it felt wrong
Nothin' ever stopped you
From showin' your progression suddenly
Broken lies
Driving backwards
Making all the wrong turns, saying all the wrong words
Dodging angels

If that money dirty, make it dance
25 karats cost a mansion
Gold rose petals, bottle standin'
Came from the concrete, takin' chances
Pop gold Ace like a Xanny
I just need the blessin' from your family
Broken lies, ain't no love without us
It will die, roses turn into dust
Every night, we gettin' more popular
Wrong is right when it comes to us

You know I'm independent, get the 'rillo, bust a jug
You know that purple reign had them hitters on foot
I see you acting strange, I can tell this ain't love

I'm acting like a Freeband Gang terrorist
Red cup of lean, don't approach me like a junkie
Take a pledge to the team, we gon' kill and get money
International, we taking over all the countries
Any nationality they coming, baby, coming
Ride shotgun in the foreign, that's a Rover
Until you gun down, we gon' never have closure
Got real estate downtown, investing all over
I heard you're trying to talk down like I ain't focused
I know you tryna play around like I ain't got soldiers
Big cup of syrup washing down all my doja
Wearing Louis loafers like they old penny loafers
Started off local, got the cribs bi-coastal
I don't want no words with you 'cause you mad bogus
I'm just tryna motivate the hoods all over
I'm just tryna teach you how to get these whips loaded
I'm just tryna show you how to get a few Rollies

[Chorus 1]
Purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple-
I just need my girlfriend
I just need my girlfriend
I just need-
Purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple-
I just need my girlfriend
I just need my girlfriend
I just need-
[Verse 3]
Hope I didn't come at you the wrong way, that wasn't planned
Hope you see the path that I made, I took a chance
I just put my passion and drive into this
Two cups of that dirty, take a dab, blow kush and
We ain't gonna talk about it, cut you off if you keep pushing
Since I got the fame, can't forget I was crooked
They wanna see me make the wrong move, bite the bullet
See me whip up in that new school just like a bullet
[Chorus 2]
Purple reign, purple-
I just need my girlfriend
I just need my girlfriend
I just need-
Purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple-
Purple reign, purple reign
I just need my girlfriend
I just need my girlfriend
I just need-

[Outro]
Purple reign, purple reign is understood
Purple Reign, purple reign is in...

I'm lookin' for 'er
I'm lookin' for 'er
I'm lookin' for 'er
I'm lookin' for 'er
[Verse 1]
Is that her in the VIP-line
With the Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent
Used to drive a Nissan now she in a Bimmer
I don't want 'er cause she from the corner
And I heard that Bimmer was a loaner
Her old man, the owner
And don't even drink Corona's
What type of drink you want bruh
On champagne forever
On dirty sprite forever
You can come sip with me
If you'd like to change the weather
If you wanna live better
We can buy a crib, where ever
Don't get too thirsty, get used to the cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see 'er 'fore I do tell 'er I wish that I've met 'er
[Chorus]
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she keep her promises, and never turn on you
I heard she ain't gon' cheat and she gon' never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need 'er, she come through
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er

[Verse 2]
Send 'er my way
Tell 'er I've been lookin' for 'er in the broad day
Hangin' with the dope boys in the hallways
And I know, to keep 'er, yeah you gotta get that pay
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she got a pretty face and stand up like a stallion
I heard that she a precious jewel, you treat her to medallions
I wanna be the one to find out if I go to prowlin'
And if I get her number, you know I can't wait to dial it
And if we get together, girl, you know we gon' be wildin'
And when we get together we make magic and it’s ours
Whenever you up here, ain't nun nobody can do about it
[Chorus]
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she keep her promises, and never turn on you
I heard she ain't gon' cheat and she gon' never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need 'er, she come through

I’m lookin' for 'er
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er

[Verse 3]
She a hood girl
But she a good girl
She been mislead
Now she ready for the world
I want your energy
To take control of me
I've tried to go to sleep
And seen 'er in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today I'ma stay clean
Just in case you recognize her face, send 'er to me
And tell 'er I’ve been lookin' for 'er with a flashlight
You can't tell a nigga nothin' because I got my cash right
And tell 'er if she honest I promise to stay true
Make sure, when you tell 'er, tell 'er we goin' past the moon
[Chorus]
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she keep her promises, and never turn on you
I heard she ain't gon' cheat and she gon' never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need 'er, she come through
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er

I think me and Esco crazy
I think me and Young 'Sco crazy
I did fifty-six broads on the European tour and they was all crazy
I did fifty-six broads on the European tour and they was all crazy
I took fifty-six bars all in one month nigga and I'm still dranking
I could still see the scar on a nigga hand, man this shit real crazy
I been taking these molly's, still nodding off 'cause a nigga too faded
I've been laying low key inside a nigga vault, money is my motivation
[Verse 1]
Money keep a nigga motivated
Molly keep a nigga motivated
Percocet keep 'em motivated
Good drank keep a nigga motivated
Lortabs on my conversation
Talk a lot of bands then we conversatin'
I was on my way to Rice Street
In the paddie wagon and it had me numb
The pain from the slum had me numb
Tryna sell some dope and eat caviar
Got the passport in Saudi Arabia
We've been flossing in medallions
We ain't nothing but some Talibans
I pull up right now and embarrass ya
I've just been hanging with savages
Lately I've been hanging around with my savages
I grew up on the block, one hunnid
I go on The Bluff, it's one hunnid
I done did enough in the jungle
I done put in some work and they love me
When I drink out the cup, it's so dirty
Had the blow at the store, they was lurking
Poured a four in a cup it was breakfast
Sprinkled sauce in my drink and I took it

[Chorus]

Promethazine took my concentration
To another level then I elevated
Diamonds hanging on me I'm intoxicated
Diamonds hanging off me I'm intoxicated
Chop it up with a sack chaser
Told you I wasn't going back, baby
Hanging out with some crack babies
Fell in love with this cash baby
Money touch a niggas hands
On a few Xans might won't count it
Spend it all in one night
If we could rewind it, we'll still do it
I'm true to this game, I jump on a plane
And run to the stage
I've been working some years for this
Making music, I live for this
Hit the trap in my Louboutins
Count it up then I bag up a brick
Mount it up then I smash out in it
You know I'm gon' do the whole dash in this motherfucker
I'm 'bout to pass out in this motherfucker
I'm 'bout to pass out in this motherfucker
This bitch exotic than a motherfucker
These bitches  do anything for me

Shout out to the shooters and the shooters only
You never walk around with a lot of money
Hundred dollars fallin' all out your pocket
When you hit 'em in the head, can you keep it solid?

Love a nigga wrist when it's shinin'
Hate a nigga wrist when it's blingin'
So I went and added more diamonds
Hot Boy, nigga, BG
That's the way these young niggas eat
Drinking on syrup, can't sleep
Keep it copacetic with your partner
Blockbuster niggas running 'round with real choppers
Nigga, what's the color of them bottles? they ain't gold
And you moving 'round with ya ho
You ain't even sticking to the code
Pimps up, pimps up, Hoes down (Hoes down)

Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine
[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Goin' insane, feel you pickin' up and movin' things inside my brain
I know I don't have to argue about everything
But we don't have the same soul
Would've sold yours too and got a bigger bankroll
You tell me that you love me, baby, say it again
Repeat it over and over until it's in my brain
Picked up the drugs so I let my brain go
Woulda fried yours too, but I'm selfish about my Percs, oh

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine
[Verse 2: Future]
I'm so crazy about mine (Wheezy outta here)
I'm goin' to Pluto with my girl (Oh, shorty)
I'm goin' to Jupiter with my girl (Don't call your exes)
I'm goin' to Mars with my girl (Don't call your exes)
I'm goin' to Saturn with my girl
Been feelin' like I'm runnin' out of space
You need to send your location, I can't think
I done fell in love twice but I gotta be lyin'
'Cause I'm livin' ten lives, I go crazy about mines, ayy
[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine

[Outro: Juice WRLD]
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine

Red Leather
186 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsRed Leather Lyrics[Intro: Future]
So you thinkin' that you gon', I ain't gon'
Speak from my heart, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm one thousand
Yeah
[Chorus: Future]
I done turned a dancer to a trophy
I done balled with rings like Kobe
Never send a tweet with emotions, uh
She heard I sip lean, she got emotional
Codeine got my heart like opium
I can feel her heart beatin' when I'm huggin' her
Take me back to Kingston to see my ancestors
Pissin' on your grave in some red leather
[Verse 1: Future]
Turbo Panamera, the seat bird feathers
Keep La on mе like Carmelo
Don't lie to mе, I'm on God levels
Forever's not long enough
If it's endless, what we doin'?
Either you a rebel or what we doin'?
Toast codeine, trap stars, what we doin'?
A few remain nameless deserve my dedication
I just want my movement like Larry Davis
Came from Amsterdam, had my head up
Screenshot bitches got me fed up
Playin' with the white for green like a Celtic
She ain't tryna share me, she thinkin' selfish
I just bought my young bitch some new Rosettas
Went to Tokyo, I had to hit the ghetto
Like to kick it with her 'cause she play soccer
Introduced her to some goons, nigga, and some robbers
Now she want that Bentayga and it's obvious
Real patience for them big faces and I got it
Still faded from the last night off molly
The ones work at Magic, work at Follies
I just left Onyx and caught a body
Fuck your wife at the back of King of Diamonds
Turn me on, she don't care I put my thumb in
Leave me all alone, I'm throwin' a party
How I'm gon' have commitment in this world of sin?
Try my best to love you in this world we in
Take another look at every foreign I'm in
End up with the bitches that I started with
I must've been on a pill when I recorded this
Had the stick in my hand while I was typin' it
I know I'm arrogant, but don't be trifling
I iced out you once and you got iced again
These guitars sound like Parliament
I just blowed a check, baby, pardon me
All-black trim, dark burgundy
Keep it real with me, no perjury
Put them bags on her arm like weighed sand
Saks Fifth Avenue, she ran through eighty bands
Got your passport ready, we some aliens
Got my transporter up out my radius
Got my transporter, whip Mercedes-Benz
I could never give up on what we had
Abracadabra, make my side bitch better
Chanel trench, pussy taste like pineapple
I'ma stay down with you, but don't give me a headache
Lifestyle's radical, please excuse the medies
California housing, gettin' better with my veggies
Audemars, Richard Mille came in a FedEx
Smash her like a grudge that I ain't never gettin' deaded
Sippin' on mud while I'm lookin' at my presi'
Presidential tints in the back, I done made it
Bitch, you better stay on your shit, you gettin' graded
Take you to a spa in Saint Barts, is you ready?
Whip the double-R with the stars in the headrest
Caught up with these broads, baby, did I change the address?
Times got hard and I fucked off your lashes
Everything real, I got my gold veneers added
Motherfuckin' addict, but I will rock a Patek
If your love was a drug, maybe it would be acid
I know I lost your trust, but I made you relapse
I gotta be on a pill to tell you how I'm feelin'
I tippy-toe and I dance with the devil
I'll take a whole boat out to Bahamas
Shawty ride for a real one like a gunner

[Chorus: Future]
I done turned a dancer to a trophy
I done balled with rings like Kobe
Never send a tweet with emotions, uh
She heard I sip lean, she got emotional
Codeine got my heart like opium
I can feel her heart beatin' when I'm huggin' her
Take me back to Kingston to see my ancestors
Pissin' on your grave in some red leather
Pissin' on your grave in some red leather
[Interlude: Future & J. Cole]
Forever's not long enough
If it's endless, what we doin'?
Toast codeine, trap stars, what we doin'? (Yeah)
[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Pluto got twenty girlfriends, damn, I'm doin' it wrong
Cut off all my hoes, now I'm only puttin' you in a song
Day one, shawty been with me from the playground
Hey now, maybe that's the reason I was playin' 'round
Runnin' like a chicken with his head cut off
Through the streets where the freaks love the red leather
On my shoulder blades, in my older age
See the error of my ways, but I'm still not totally over all the temptation
Why does sin give you all the sensation?
Yeah, I'm with Future up in Onyx just wastin'
A lot of money on a stripper education
Throw so much paper that we causin' the inflation
Now it's late and I'm gettin' impatient
Might run a train on a bitch, Penn Station
Nah, I'm playin', I'm just lit, gettin' wasted
And she whisper in my ear she wanna taste it
Damn, you makin' it hard for me
But I'm stayin' strong, I got authority
Willpower, when I dub a baddie, I feel power
Me and Astro 6'4", we the Twin Towers
Twin Glocks with the switch piece that extend shots
It's a metaphor for the boy when you in proximity
I can't stop right now, they gon' remember me forever
My stories more clever, my similes was better
My energy was never on some toughest nigga shit
I was just a conscious rapper that would fuck a nigga bitch
I was just a college nigga from a rougher premises
Kept my nose out the streets, but I love to get a whiff
Of the action, with risk comes attraction
The blicks get to blastin', I turn into a track star
Wanted all the hoes, what the fuck you think I rap for?
I been tryna slang the same wood since Hacksaw
Jim Duggan, runnin' through the Ville in my Timbs, thuggin'
Now I'm with Young Metro in the V.I.P., bitches incomin'
Coppin' all this liquor for these hoes like we McLovin
Thinkin' to myself, "Could I really be with one woman?"
Hmm, I think so
But it's hard when you with your dogs at the freak show
Thinkin' I could bag Rubi Rose with a keystroke
Ego, ask yourself is that gon' bring you peace, though?

[Outro: Future & J. Cole]
(Shit, I don't know)
Forever's not long enough
If it's endless, what we doin'?
Either you a rebel, what we doin'?
Toast codeine, trap stars, what we doin'?

Purple Reign
Wizard
Yeah
Thinkin' about them licks I hit, I had to
Thinkin' about if you was here, I had you
Savage
Gon' roll it up, my nigga
Roll up, jump out the car, and squeeze the trigger
Gon' roll it up, my nigga
Roll up, hop out the car, and squeeze the trigger
[Chorus]
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Perkies callin'
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Xannies callin'
I can hear them Percs callin'
I can hear the workers callin'
I can hear the streets callin'
I can hear the streets callin'
[Verse 1]
Thinkin' about them licks I hit, I had to
Thinkin' about if you was here, I had you
Thinkin' about that cash like it's fast food
I'm thinkin' about this cash like it's fast food
I'm payin' all my tithes, receivin' bad news
Lord, forgive me for my sins, I know this cash rules
Everything around me turn to fast food
Standin' in the cold, I ain't got no blanket
These hoes always gettin' exposed, ain't got home trainin'
And when I push up in that Rolls and I'm still drankin'
Went from standin' over stoves to the tour bus
Stayed down, ten toes, board the G5
So much yellow gold on me like a beehive
Started rockin' Balmain's like they Levi's
Over time, the booth is like a gold mine
I served in Alabama like Roll Tide

[Chorus]
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Perkies callin'
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Xannies callin'
I can hear them Percs callin'

[Verse 2]
Aquafina water got me glistenin'
When I whip that Bimmer, can't you picture me rollin'?
Fuck you pussy niggas, ain't no sympathy
Niggas tellin' lies, they so feminine
I be sellin' pies, chasin' M&Ms
Fuck a nine-to-five, get it out the gym
Push illegal weight, we call it out the gym
Knock 'em off on tape, that's murder on film
I need better thoughts, I need better vibes
Focus on the top and let my nigga slide
I need more advice and ain't got no time
Hustlin', doin' right, feel like I waited a lifetime
Weigh up both sides 'cause your life ain't like mines
Pay me no mind, I ain't payin' no fine
Everything I did was for my hood this whole time
I'm talkin' this whole time, for my hood this whole time
Gotta take advantage, gotta learn how to take advantage, dawg
Stole a golf cart, I go and buy a ballpark
Drove a stolen car and now my car a push start
I'm from the apartments, my crib big like Walmart

[Chorus]
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Perkies callin'
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Xannies callin'
I can hear them Percs callin'
I can hear the workers callin'
I can hear the streets callin'
I can hear the streets callin'

Gon' roll it up, my nigga
Roll up, jump out the car, and squeeze the trigger
Gon' roll it up, my nigga
Roll up, hop out the car, and squeeze the trigger

My Collection
119 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeMy Collection Lyrics[Intro]
I've been in the stu late, workin', no residuals
If we never speak again, I'm just glad I got to tell the truth
I ain't done countin'
You wanna come to paradise?
Matter of fact, you wanna come to Pluto?
Ha-ha
[Verse 1]
She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
She got a few athletes on speed dial
I'm tryna get the case dismissed before I see trial
And these codeine habits ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child
No this codeine ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child
I used to sell dope at my grandma's house, as a rude child
All these cameras on, fuckin' with my mood, wild
And these chains clinkin' back and forth, they too loud
They know damn well this wasn't promised
I know damn well this must be karma
Left every pair of Margielas at the condo
Technically I never packed up and leave
Left eighty racks in the dresser, you can keep
And I got this bad ting at disposal
I cooked it up and then I went global
My baby mama push a Range Rover
Had to make sure I got it fully loaded
Can't be the one and then you get exposed
If you the one, then God will let me know
But at the same time, I like to vibe with one
I'm paranoid, I gotta ride with one
And I had to 'splain to her last night
Had to send this one freak on the last flight

[Segue]
Had to send this one freak on the last flight
[Chorus]
Won't get a response from me, ain't no confessions
Before I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'
Any time I got you, girl you my possession
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
[Verse 2]
Standin' on Black Sox, meet me at the yacht dock
Icin' out the clock, watch, bitches on my cock
Yeah, maybe it's the drop, yeah, we get in our feelings, yeah
I don't know how you would feel about if I ain't have millions, yeah
I'm conversin' with you, I hope you hear me, yeah
Keep my promise, take my love with you everywhere
And hell no, it ain't about no braggin' rights
But even if it was, shit, I got it
Pinstripes on a hardtop Bugatti
She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
I'ma keep it genuine and tell the truth to you
I got this jawn, she know what to do with me
And right now I don't know what to do with you
I don't wanna sound like I'm bein' rude with you
She caught a red eye, leavin' L.A
I shoulda gave her to the valet
And I had to tell her 'bout Miami
After she came with no panty

[Chorus]
Won't get a response from me, ain't no confessions
Before I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'
Any time I got you, girl you my possession
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection

Aw yeah
Aw yeah, aw yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Check this out
[Verse 1]
I get mad zooted, I got this bad thing I recruited
My passion is a movie, I say fuck her 'cause I screwed her
I stay on Miley Cyrus, everywhere I go I'm screwed up
I know my Texas niggas got my back and that's for sure though
Sippin' on Easter Pink like it's Tanqueray
We ain't never gon' give this perfect life up
I know the boys saying they gettin' to the money over there
Baby, trust me, these niggas nothin' like us
I put charisma in my lingo and she fell for me
I gave her realness, and that’s all she gonna get from me
Bona fide superstar, I'm straight up out the hood-uh
I just did a dose of Percocets with some strippers
[Chorus]
I just did a dose of Percocet with some strippers
I just poured this lean in my cup like it's liquor
I just need a whole lot of drugs in my system
I just tried acid for the first time, it feel good

[Verse 2]
Treasure bring misery, codeine in my delivery
I pulled up in a big B, swervin' like a hippie
Movin' with the dopers and pushers
In the Rover duckin' undercover, huggin' the Interstate
Coppin' a couple cakes and the drum hangin' under me
Got a chain hangin' over me
God watching over me, all my angels watch over me
I bag it like groceries, keep some cash flowing over me
Got some money all in my hand and I stack it all under me
The young niggas under me, they gon' stand up in any war
We built this shit ground up like the head of a seminar
I talk for the real ones
I talk for them niggas that feel this shit out in Belgium
Freeband Gang
[Chorus]
I just did a dose of Percocet with some strippers
I just poured this lean in my cup like it's liquor
I just need a whole lot of drugs in my system
I just tried acid for the first time, It feel good

Yeah...
I ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
I ain't even try'n desert you
Stop try'na be this way
I ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you...
[Chorus]
I ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be that way
I ain't mean to desert you
Sorry that it look that way
Ain't really tryna hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
I ain't really try'n hurt you
Sorry it gotta be that way
I ain't really tryin'
I ain't really tryin'
[Verse 1]
I was in the U.K. thinkin' – shit don't feel the same
Addy got me daydreamin', hope I ain't goin' insane
Hard to say you care about me
When this mink draggin' to the floor
Tryna find a P.Y.T., I already got some at home
I breathe the air she breathe
It's hard to breathe on my own
It's somethin' 'bout infidelity
Make me check every single stone
Y'all done drank my blood like a Hebrew
'Cause I've been gettin' fly since a diesel
Made her switch sides in Ibizoo
I can get you off there in Belgium
Diamonds shinin' off very seldom
Grab a couple chicks, then mail them
Take it to the hood, then sell them
Fam come first, never fail them
Rebellious, always respect my elders
That's why I might treat you like I'm careless
Sold crack to a pregnant lady
Forgive me for the crack baby
If I open up my eyes, it turn black for real
Pack was too small, I ain't have it vacuum-sealed
Word to Uncle Charles, nigga, I got the set for real
Money, broads, lawyers cost a half a mil'
Fame change family, that's the way it is
Fame change a ho, that's the way I give
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal

[Chorus]
I ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
I ain't even try'n desert you
Stop try'na be this way
I ain't really mean to hurt you
I ain't really mean to hurt you
I ain't really tryin'
[Verse 2]
It can get scary when you legendary
Caramel complexion, that's a Halle Berry
Cash rules everything around music
The game doped up, every nigga usin'
Grab the fuckin' carpet, hit 'em with the two
I'm not tryna argue, I got issues
You see what I been put up against, baby?
You see why I been tryna make the rent, baby?
Tryna keep you closer than lint, baby
Diamond Rolls, 'bout to get Lynch, baby
It's hard to caress you
All your bad energy, it's hard to bless you
Commercial flights gettin' too hectic
V12 motor's my confession
Tryin' to identify, you look sketchy
I'm a real nigga, it's hard to accept it

[Chorus]
I ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
I ain't even try'n desert you
Stop try'na be this way
I ain't really mean to hurt you
I ain't really mean to hurt you
I ain't really tryin'

Hot tender "Roni" – Bobby Brown, ooh
Chop this up for me, I got somethin' to prove
Work every day like I got somethin' to lose
Oxycod' got me floatin' up, nothin' new
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Money stacked up, an' it got me seduced
I got that hot dope, but I got that boost doe
Aye – my Lamb' hit a pothole, these bitches some thot hoes
I hit the lotto in South Africano
Yacht party, sittin' at the dock of the condo
Better not be late, bitch, you better come pronto
Better come with a combo
Asian persuasion, Cubana, mijaña
Yolanda, Shalonda, mi añá muy paza
I don't know Spanish, I barely talk proper
It became problems when I didn't send flowers
King like Mufasa, Messiah, then higher
Gold sheets and Rollies, yeah, fuck all the police
Shout out my whodie, he smashin' the CO
My wrist got a ego, my watch in an igloo
We took it legal, got stripes like a zebru
Live like a Rolling Stone, high when I greet you
Diamonds just all on you, effortlessly ball on you
L-O-to-V-E, I hope you ain’t gettin' greedy
Chasers do numbers, man, chains is on Fiji
Couldn'ta had your heart, 'cause ya gave it too easy
Diamonds on sight that's way brighter than Geezy's
Shout out to D.D., got goonies on speedy
She like it rated, ain't nothin' 'bout her PG
I had evaded, I thought I was jaded
Persian, Malaysian, super sensation
Yah – sushi was raw when she got confiscated
No invitations, we showed up and made it
Long as my dawgs here, bitches be tradin'
Pigeons contagious, I shoulda known it
I turned the pages, heavily sedated
Too many clone me, too many phonies
Armani on me, you never worn me
How can you blame us when we all out the trenches?
Gold chains and rings, it's so easy gettin' offended
Spendin' all your show money tryna keep up with my image
Fuck around, take a O from me, and never give a penny
Fuck y'all, I skrrt off, 'cause everything shitty
I hit my first model, stepped up my pimpin'
Caught her off the runway, she instantly committed
Paper got my mind gone, too caught up on my city
In and out of time zones, runnin' up a billi'
Indian Cherokee, clarity, shinin' is therapy
Mami Israeli (Mami Israeli...)

[Chorus]
I ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
I ain't even try'n desert you
Sorry, ain't tryna be this way
I ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you...
Ain't really mean to hurt you...
Ain't really mean to hurt you...
I ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be that way
Ain't mean to desert you
Sorry that it look that way
I ain't really try'n hurt you
I ain't really mean to hurt you
I ain't really tryin'

To my watch and my chain, it's gon' drizzle, gon' drizzle

Fake written all over you
Hate written all over you
Fake written all over you

Sometimes pretend to be your friend
Smiling faces show no traces

Fake written all over you
Hater written all over you
Fake written all over you, yeah
[Verse 1: Future]
I been in the cold, couldn't feel my toes, but I still stuck to the code
Money won't fold, pockets won't hold enough
Takin' my pole in there, F&N in there
Take me anywhere, I'm takin' over the trap
I see the real clear, woodgrain Cartier
Poppin' a real pill, higher than Beverly Hills
I got too much spill, I give a bitch chills
Took out a small bill, make all the hoes strip
You need a weed feel, I get it vacuum sealed
Came from the Eastside, shooters on detail
Go purchase a new Chanel, I need a refill
Strikers in Trackhawks, ridin' the V12
I peeped the mood, dog, I peeped the intel
Get to trippin', all you gon' see is shells

[Chorus: Future, Joe Harris & 2Pac]
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

I don't need another fake friend, dog
Can't be 'bout a ho, 'cause we sharin', dog
In your feelings, nigga, why you playin', dog?
Give her backshots while she layin' down
Keep the Glock cocked, I don't trust hoes
Top shotter, goin' for the gusto
Like a real dog, got a mutt ho
Get the lo', you a John Doe
Bubble-eye Benz on a ho
Rappin' so pretend, you a ho
Nine-figure nigga, tag a toe
Ain't no tappin' in, better blow
Shorty poppin' pills, but he blessed
Flash a couple M's on my chest
Ain't no sabotagin', lil' finesse
We was in the field, placin' bets
Still gettin' chills in my flesh
Takin' karma, turn it to success
Thoroughbred and Pluto, nothin' less
Twenty drivers parked at the jet
Whip the Phantom to the projects
Death before dishonor, no confess

Kno the Meaning
81 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoPortuguêsKno the Meaning Lyrics[Intro]
My uncle Ronnie used to wash cars
My uncle Wayne was a kingpin, you know what I'm saying?
My uncle Don, that nigga used to rob banks and shit, rest in peace
My granddaddy was a boss, he was a kingpin, you heard?
[Chorus]
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'
[Interlude 1]
Dropped Monster tape and had to go to Europe
[Verse 1]
Best thing I ever did was fall out of love
'Sco came to me, said, "They think you washed up
You need to go back in, show these niggas who the one"
We going back in soon as we get off tour
He had my hard drive on him when he caught the case
When they took him into custody, they took my life away

[Interlude 2]
People didn't even understand that
My hard drives that I recorded all my music on
For two years straight was on this...
Was on this one hard drive that Esco had
And he was locked up with it
So I had to record new music
That's when I did Beast Mode
[Verse 2]
I'm fresh off the plane on them Zaytiggys
I endured so much pain, ain't got 'Sco with me
Ain't got nobody to smoke one or pour with me
Niggas rocked the lean, man, when I was OT
And I'm still dealin' with the time they gave Doe B
How he gon' catch an armed robbery around me?
And my lifestyle getting way bigger
I got so much love for my niggas
Brown paper bag, we gettin' back to the paper
Gettin' back to the basics
Everything I did, it was premeditated
I just knew there'd come a time when I finally did make it
And some niggas started hatin'
I ain't never had no problem with these niggas
I've been about my guala from the dodo
Got an R&B chick layin' on me, no photo
Got a combo in the condo doin' some real life porno

[Bridge]
And I ain't worried 'bout nothin' in the world, keep a badass bitch
These niggas ain't none of my worries, damn that shit
There's so much more I gotta endure
I just had my baby, gotta go on tour (fuck that shit)
[Chorus]
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'
[Verse 3]
I ain't holding this back, I ain't holding this
The music way ahead of its time and I notice this
Get back in the studio, give 'em what they was missing
They didn't know I knew the game and I know how to reinvent it
They ain't know me in the cut, they just know me from rhymin'
My hard work finally catchin' up with perfect timin'
[Interlude 3]
You know what I'm saying
I could take a hundred dollar slab
And goddamn make three hundred off that bitch, you dig?

[Chorus]
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'
[Outro]
Everything in the streets
It prepared me for everything that I'm going through right now
The good and the bad, you know what I'm saying?
Can't let none of this shit get to me
I go harder 'cause I know where I was at
And I know where I wanna go

Yeah, yeah, yeah, 'cause

A perfect love story don't matter anyway that's all for the cameras

You can see the love in the eyes of the kid that was lost and he turned to a rebel
Mama don't give up on me I'm a rebel

Pinky ring your show advance
I just sent a telegram
Grandma, your boy the man (Uh)
Necklace gave me shoulder cramps
Pinky ring your show advance
Bracelet, Rollie, both 'em dance (Uh)
A half a mill' on both 'em hands
[Refrain: Future & A$AP Rocky]
I'm a trap nigga, better watch your ho (Uh)
Ain't no bap, nigga kickin' in your door (Nigga)
Yeah (Woo), Chrome Hearty, I just bought the whole store
I blew her head up, now they call her the GOAT
Turned the swag up, her last nigga was broke
Bought all them bags for her, can't fit 'em in her closet
She can change the 'fit up least 'bout three times a day
Ain't use a condom, we fuck three times a day

[Verse 1: Future]
This bitch so pretty, I wanna skeet it on her face
I done took the Adderall just to count up my cake
I'm goin' Bugatti shoppin', fuckin' up this paper
First time I smashed it, I was highly sedated
It get past 3 a.m., I'm way out of my mind
Cost three-eighty and it barely got any diamonds
Skeleton, faded, spent a rack on it
My lawyer gon' eat the case, that's what these racks for
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Necklace gave me shoulder cramps
Pinky ring your show advance
I just sent a telegram
Grandma, your boy the man
Necklace gave me shoulder cramps
Pinky ring your show advance
Bracelet, Rollie, both 'em dance
A half a mill' on—
[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Verse one
Call up Pluto, Metro, should've put me on the first one
Niggas swear they bitch the baddest, I just bagged the worst one
Niggas in they feelings over women, what, you hurt or somethin'?
I smashed before you birthed, son, Flacko hit it first, son
Still don't trust you, it's always us, never them
Heard you dropped your latest shit
Funny how it just came and went (Ha-ha-ha)
Money long, but you know I gotta keep it trim (Trim)
Her waist small, but she ain't slim
They call me Flacko Jodye, but I'm him (GR!M)
Ain't shit change, bitch
Upgraded a lame bitch
Stay up in your lane, bitch
My wrist a plain jane, bitch
She fuck me 'cause I'm famous
And they don't speak my language
But bet she know my name, bitch
A stainless 'cause I don't trust a thing, bitch (Why don't you trust me?)
Fuck on her tongue, but really I just hit a lick (Lick, lick)
No more Balenci' (Uh), I'm gettin' really tired of Rick (Tired of that shit)
Cough up a lung (Lung), that Bloomin' new Biscotti hit ('Scotti)
First of the month (Uh, month), I'm livin' in your head rent-free (Boominati, nigga)

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Necklace gave me shoulder cramps
Pinky ring your show advance
I just sent a telegram
Grandma, your boy the man
Necklace gave me shoulder cramps
Pinky ring your show advance
Bracelet, Rollie, both 'em dance
A half a mill' on both 'em hands
[Refrain: Future & A$AP Rocky]
I'm a trap nigga, better watch your ho (Can I trust you?)
Ain't no bap, nigga kickin' in your door (Nigga)
Chrome Hearty, I just bought the whole store
I blew her head up, now they call her the GOAT
Turned the swag up, her last nigga was broke (Uh)
Bought all them bags for her, can't fit 'em in her closet
She can change the 'fit up least 'bout three times a day (Uh)
[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck keepin' this shit hip-hop
I wanna see a fuck nigga bleed out (Nigga)
(I knew we couldn't trust them)
Everybody's doin' it down there
We really, you know, we was the ones that originated it in the first place
So we gon' stick to the script
They'll leave our style alone 'fore we leave it alone, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?

My Savages
59 ContributorsMy Savages Lyrics[Intro]
I be on the phone with Doe Boy, I be telling him
He inspired me to go harder
You know what I'm saying? Real talk
Will-Will-Will-William
[Verse 1]
My savages, my savages, my savages
I'm always dressing fresher than a mannequin
I grew up in a ruthless ass environment
I'm on the phone with Yo, I ask him how the trial went
Thirty-five racks is how my day was spent
I gotta cock it back, that's how my day would get
You got me thinking all these bitches artificial
The way you acting, you must don't respect a real nigga
Roll some herb up, pour some syrup up
They tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us
I told you way before what happened, they was hating on us
You know when we was jugging for it they was mad at us
Ayy, this a letter for my dawgs, how we let the money get between us?
How we let these bitches get between us?
How we let these niggas get between us?
I got love for all my savages with itchy fingers
I got love but it ain't like the love I got for India
She held me down when I was broke, I got her to infinity
My lil' dawg caught a murder, gone for infinity
Dumping ashes on your obituary, I know you feeling me
R.I.P. my granddad Quick, he should have seen this shit
Twenty thousand on some child support, I seen this shit
Riding around with all them choppers, I done seen this shit
These rappers mad at me, but these niggas ain't doing shit
And I just bought a pound of kush so I can smoke that shit
I went and spent a half a ticket at the dealership
The fame is doing a lot of damage to my friendships
If Esco didn't love me, would've been done jumped ship
And it's the love from my fans got me still here

[Interlude]
Monster, ah
Say I'm Illuminati
They tryna make me catch a body
[Verse 2]
I don't know when I'ma flip, nigga
Get me some codeine and sip, nigga
Big Bank saying wipe a nigga's nose
My girl changed the lock on the doors
Said fuck that shit, poured up a four
Ain't falling in love with no ho
That what you want for me?
That what you really expect?
You thinking I'm sitting up depressed?
I'm somewhere countin' up me a check
I hate I had to fuck with any of you niggas, that's my only regret
Drag the mink on the floor
Put Cuban links on my ho
Ten whips in a row, who would think we were poor?
Who would think we was poor?
There's money laying on the floor
Got some hoes laying on some hoes
Got lil' shawty with me, she a pro
Know she'll never meet another nigga, not another nigga like me
Even if he got a billion dollars, he can't make her cum like me
Who compliment you like me? It better be about an image
Tell me all of this a gimmick, they thought the whips got rented
Because the Spur wasn't tinted, I told 'em ain't got nothing to hide
Told 'em I'm through with the pies
Told 'em fuck all of my wrongs, I don't even write
My savages, my savages, my savages
We gon' leave a nigga stiffer than a mannequin

[Outro]
Free all my niggas incarcerated, you heard me?
Loyal for life, you heard?
Freeband Gang
We global now

Yeah
This bitch from Australian and I'm an alien
(808 Mafia)
[Chorus]
I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy, but I love it, baby
When I jump out the whip, when I hop out the whip then I'm fresh in the latest
I do what I want, 'cause I smoke 'til I'm faded
I drink 'til I pass out, I wake up and drink up again
I pour up again and again
I said I wasn't gon' fuck with that bitch, then I fucked her again
I scream out the gutter in the sewer, the streets turned a boy to a man
I nodded off with that Ruger, I took your bitch to Aruba
She fuck with Super 'cause she got that super
When I say super, that's young Super Future
We never gon' lose, we never gon' lose
[Verse]
Never gon' lose 'cause these bitches gon' choose
These bitches gon' be who they is
Walkin' and talkin' like classy
You ho to your heart, you a ho to your heart
You know I'll be workin' that boy, I'ma pour it
Servin' that boy out the back of the yard
Fuck on your ho, I'm just playin' my cards
Whip after whip put up in the garage
Sip on the lean like a fifth of the dark
Hop in the Spur, then might hop in the Porsche
Telly then rally and gather the squad
Yeah, girl eat the squad
Me and my niggas so mothafuckin' tight
You can't even tell us apart
Fuck a bitch every single damn night
Ain't nothin' but an avatar
Valet the car on the curb like I'm swervin' on alcohol
Get to poppin' them Percocets and Xanax like they some Tylenol
I remember nights in Europe sayin' we ain't fallin' off
I'm on a lot of green, we gotta have some green
When I hit the plane and I board it
I got a magazine with no Visine
Just ridin' around with this .40
She gon' thug for me, she gon' thug for me
In Ohio, that's my shorty
We ain't playin' around
These diamond rings are gon' go up inside your noggin
You see they try sabotage me, then copy
They wasn't playin' fair, no-no, no-no, no-no
Bitch is a bozo, she clown in the photos
We sell that coco, you talkin' to po-po
You know that's a no, though, you know that's a no-no
Know that's a no-no, no-no-no, no-no-no
Came at the door, pour, serve out the paddy door
Bitch I'm your man and your daddy, ho
Panty droppers had no panties on
Bitch, you steppin' in, no panties on
Back with these stallions
Back-to-back, back, back-to-back with these stallions
Like she trunk after trunk, I just carry on
Got the sack on me, now I just carry it
Got some M's in New Orleans, I buried it
For the cash and some M's, I'll marry it
See the way they just jumped on the bandwagon
Went bought a G-Wagon
Fifty-six nights, I had to get at it
Mayweather, Pacquiao, nigga, we still at it
Get up and get at it, guns like I'm Bin Laden

[Chorus]
I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy, but I love it, baby
When I jump out the whip, when I hop out the whip then I'm fresh in the latest
I do what I want, and I smoke 'til I'm faded
I drink 'til I pass out, I wake up and drink up again
I pour up again and again
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch, then I fucked her again
I scream out the gutter and the sewer, the streets turned a boy to a man
I nodded off with that Ruger, I took your bitch to Aruba
She fuck with Super 'cause she got that super
When I say super, that's young Super Future
We never gon' lose, we never gon' lose
[Outro]
Woo
These bitches gon' choose
We never gon' lose

You know how we be rocking, ya heard
[Verse 1]
Bright light shining all bright on the Bentley
Work the Cadillac, panoramic, no panties
Old school Chevy '55 granddaddy
Gotta throw some salt on it, 'cause you know I'm getting at it
Throw the fork on it, then put it in traffic
Throw the sauce on it, got it flying out of Dallas
Hope you didn't do it to yourself, that's tragic
Hope you didn't throw away what we established
Hope you wouldn't turn your back on your family
The way a nigga look 'round here, they'll back stab you
Word from your motherfuckin' brother, young nigga
I just wanna see you happy, I just wanna see you happy
Comin' through the cut, like a known Grim Reaper
'Bout to get it straight finessed, tryna get a little cheaper
Hold on to that clip, like a doped up needle
Girl hang on that strip with a four Desert Eagle
[Chorus]
Known to put a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
Ayy, where ya mans at? Heard that the feds got 'em
I seen you cruise the Land Rover through the west side
Gold Rolex, better check your peripheral
It's a full moon in the middle of the day
Got them wolves out, rock a little Cartier
Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
Know a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday
Tell them young niggas grind 'fore you gon' knock someone down, if they gon' shoot, then shoot something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'
Man down over yonder, young came through holdin' on the cane like a drummer
They done took a boss out, nigga, no wonder
Niggas gettin' crossed out, nigga, no wonder
Hoes gettin' X'd out and we on ganja
The police wanna talk, but we won't say nothin'
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'
Niggas true to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'

[Verse 2]
Had the Parkay jumpin' out the Pyrex
High definition glass on my pinky finger
Niggas swimmin' in the water, no paddle
Niggas trying to walk in my shadow
The bird on the bezel, I'm a well known rebel
Told the young nigga, "Freebandz, Roc-A-Fella"
Told a young nigga, "Freebandz, Roc-A-Fella"
You can turn this off and I can kick it acapella
We work the Front Street, where Mama said, "Don't go," we went there
Trap house embalmed with that crack, then we went there
Shawty don't fuck with these folks, these niggas be tellin' these days, be tellin' these days
[Chorus]
Known to put a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
Ayy, where ya mans at? Heard that the feds got 'em
I seen you cruise the Land Rover through the west side

Chopping bricks like karate (Chwaaa, chwaaa)
Drink a bunch of codeine (Drank)
Serving to the dope fiends (They smokers)
Blowing money, stay clean (Freebandz)

Never Stop
84 ContributorsNever Stop Lyrics[Intro]
I will never stop, never stop
Keep goin', keep goin'
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
[Verse]
I make Yeezy Boost moves in my Reeboks
It ain't gon' never stop
Tryna run a billion up until my ankle pop, yeah
You'll get rich and have problems that you never thought
It bring tears knowin' we came up out the sandbox
(Bringin' tears to my eyes)
Made it out the trenches, it got harder for my niggas
I just wanna see my dawgs ball, seven figures
I done got rich and it cursed me
Ever since I got successful, they envy
Tryna shake the devil, on promethazine
Tryna show you love but you don't feel me
Gave up on me so you turned your back
I can see the demons 'cause a nigga been blessed
I can tell you worried, but a nigga been in debt
I can't get caught up inside the matter
I should've did better, but it's chatter
I ran up my money off the gravel
Love is just a word, it don't matter to me
I got so rich, nothing matters to me
I'm livin' my second life, it's so amazin'
I done been hit with a bullet, and one grazed me
I done been considered a failure, it don't faze me
I done came up out the ghetto, my crib gated
Same niggas played with the devil, these niggas hatin'
All these bitches fuck with no rubbers, this shit brazy
Icy-ed out the Hublot, these niggas lookin' fugazi (Yeah)
Money stack tall past the ceilin', I can't be jaded
I done came from sleepin' on floors, you can't persuade me (Yeah)
I been takin' other niggas' hoes, it's gettin' outrageous (True story)
Rich nigga gettin' caught with a bitch worth minimum wages (Pluto)
Fuckin' with my ego, but I never lost a lady (Facts)
Fucked a pop star after I got my dreads braided
Never dropped her name but her head game contagious (No cap)
Twenty percent of my dames, I shipped 'em right out to Vegas (Gone)
You can feel the pain when I'm rappin' 'cause I'm ragin' (Wizard)
You can see my past and where I was on they faces (Weak)
I done flipped the truck over and crashed, ducked the agents (Facts)
I been with these blue hundreds like a nigga racist (Freebandz)
I been gettin' richer each year, feel like I'm racin' (Gone)
Tried to tell you the formula but you wouldn't take it
Hard work and perseverance, they ain't related (Ain't related)
Poppin' up on Forbes is fuckin' up my relations (Fuckin' up my family)
Ten milli' plus on a crib and it's vacant (Woo)
I can see it vividly at the crib, Rico basement  (Woo)
Watch him get the mula, I was sittin' back bein' patient (I was bein' patient)
I was sittin' back, programmin' my brain, I was in trainin' (Yeah)
I be in my coupe, Maybach, and I ain't have to trade it (Skrrt-skrrt)
Thinkin' 'bout when I was posted up when they raided (Swear I was)
Now I Double R and Ghost it up, I feel spacious (Woo)
I don't feel the safest, but I feel gracious (Yeah)
I thank God every day, I don't feel basic
Probably lose my sanity if I ain't have my babies (Sheesh)
Probably be gamblin' with my life if I ain't made it
Home invasions, and you ain't have to persuade me (Nah)
Cut it with a razor and serve it 'til your day
Came from whippin' out the bowl, Tom Ford suit and tie (Yeah)
Get my grandma to serve my dope, that ain't a lie (On God)
You can tell I've been broke when you look into my eyes (Future)
Nobody done noticed 'til the jet was in the sky

[Outro]
(Soaring, soaring)
Bringin' tears to my eyes (Oh yeah)
Nobody done noticed 'til the jet was in the sky
Bringin' tears to my eyes (Keep goin')
Gotta tell The WIZRD, it's a story like a book
Tears in my eyes
I can't forget where I came from
I lost a lover, it's alright
It can't be worse when I lost my main homie to the streets
You should've never give up on me without hearin' my side of the story
(The WIZRD)
I can't forget where I came from

Bringin' tears to my eyes

Offered her 25, keep tryin' to take some of my percentage
I was petrified, you know my right wrist authentic
I get glorified, that Richard Mille cost 250
I'm a big dog, it ain't no sense in holdin' back

Fuckin' with them strippers all in G5ive

You would fuck a rich nigga for the fame, won't you?
You would give that pussy up to a lame, won't you?
Like an old school, I re-did the frame on you
I got my old shooters with me and they land on you
Word to them niggas out the six
A whole lotta lean my nutrition
They should've told ya I had the drank on me
They should've told ya I brung a bank with me
They should've told ya I keep that molly on me
They should've told ya I got that stick with me
You the one who duckin' from a drive-by
My niggas unemployed sellin' Popeyes

I serve the base, I serve the base

I keep a shooter with me like Malone

Come and fuck with me, baby, I'm a franchise
Molly and them Xans got me aggravated
Them hundreds and them fifties, got 'em separated
Put them hundreds with them hundreds, yeah, we segregated
They tried to take the soul out me
They tried to take my confidence and they know I'm cocky
Fuck another interview, I'm done with it
I don't give a fuck about lil' ho', I let young hit it
I play the games of the thrones with you
I can't change, I was God-given
Tried to make me a pop star and they made a monster
I'm posted with my niggas lettin' the champagne flow
A nigga was depressed now my mind back home
A product of the roaches in them ashtrays
I inhale the love on a bad day
Baptized inside purple Actavis

[Pre-Chorus]
They should've told you I was on a pill
They should've told you I was on a Lear
I served cocaine in some Reeboks
I'm full of so much chronic, need a detox
[Chorus]
I serve the base, I serve the base

They should've told you I was just a trap nigga
I'm in the white house shootin' craps niggas
I gave up on my conscience, gotta live with it
This remind me when I had nightmares
These bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
They should've told you I was just a trap, nigga
They should've told you I was gon' lap niggas
They should've told you I was overseas
Say his last words, he can't breathe
They sent the ghetto bird out to peep me
They finally did admit that I was cloned
Because I was ambitious, now I'm on
Five in the mornin' on the corner rollin' stones
I just brought the money, I'll count it on my own
Fuck

G5 the flight, nigga way in the sky
G5 the flight, man, I'm way outta here
[Chorus]
G5 the flight, nigga, can't even see me
I'm way outta here, I'm too far in the sky
Hermès ashtray to dump my ashes
Bitch so pretty, look better than Cassie
Puffin' on zooties and she callin' me daddy
Walkin' on shit, turn it up and I gas it
Came out the gutter, it ain't nothin' for me to swag it
Secure the bag, got a bitch, I'ma bag it
Turnin' it up, gotta make sure shit good
Park it, two mil' in the middle of my hood
Drinkin' on mud, I made it out of thе sewer
Chrome Hеart accessories, whatever, I'm good
Lot of these niggas, they lookin' the same
They copy my lingo, they bitin' my chain
Championship, championship, Range just gon' amp this shit
Bitch break her neck just to look at the kid
[Verse 1]
Dirty the Fanta but make it in Canada
Bro get this money like it's my religion
It's gon' be a mad day, a sad day for any of these niggas
That try to compare whatever I did
Damn near touched a hundred, it just off the gig
I came out the jungle, they kidnapped a kid
I trap out a bando, spent ten on a crib
I look at the ocean to spot thirty M's
Pin it where I'm at, the city I'm in
I give you my fully, no matter where I'm in
Her hair touch her ass, she gon' think she Korean
You fuckin' me good, bitch, you helpin' me win
Niggas can't see me, ain't no competition
Too many bracelets, need a whole 'nother wrist
I'm never sober, don't think I'ma quit
I pop the E, I can feel when it kick

Count up some millions then take some more drugs
Been stuck in my memory, they wasn't showing love
Ain't matching my fly, bitch, you know you a dub
I started this wave and ain't using a brush
Stopped taking molly, I'm back on the E
Flying commercial, you ain't high as me
Driving a spaceship, the one with the wings
Cross up the trap, I done broke down a key
Ain't let no fuck nigga holdin' me back
Put a switch on it, these lil' niggas whack
After I hit your bitch, givin' her back
Ain't got no roof, put her heart on a strap
Go to the moon, ain't gon' show you no slatt
Pluto tycoon, ain't no regular 'Cat
Took a few shrooms, I forget where I'm at
Poppin' a Tesla, I feel when it kick

You in Vegas, you supposed to be with a snow bunny
You a player, huh, you wanna come around and save her
Keep it trill, you lovin' her just as much as your career
You mad ill, I knew you'd be the one to keep it real
And I can't even lie, dog, when I see y'all it gives me chills
And Imma stand behind y'all because I know the way you live
Aye just do me this favor, you give it time, time reveals

If love is all you need, I'm all you'll ever need
I can never be scared of commitment
I can prevail through life without bein' malicious
I can't hold you for responsible for your mischiefs
I hope you are never huntin' me with vengeance
I'm not predictin' anything, I'm just listenin'
Congratulations, you made it, you coulda missed it
And I'm acceptin' your past but forgiveness
And with all the mistakes I've made, you're still listenin'

If it's like that, then it's like that, got you lightin' up like lightning
I stack it up, get feisty, can’t sabotage it or ice it
You gon’ tell the world they flawed, thankful for when you nosy
You're a good girl but you’re naughty, don't you never miss out on Pilates
I let you stunt and flex in Bugattis, they don't got me, she with a body
Me and cheap girls stay cheap, we do numbers, stay fly
If it's gettin’ to you, then we fast forward, yeah
Stayin' low like a stash house, yeah

Made it with nothin', learned to swag out, yeah

I text her "So proud of you" when I got my B from CC
It is no way that you can know or see the things we see (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
She said that she can tell every time that I lie through my teeth
Plus I know you had somebody else right here in my sheets
Oh, you think you know my body?
Pull up in that Coupe, don't want no shawty
I put rubies on my Rollie, now their eyes bleed
I don't own no ice cream truck, just know my ice freeze
Man, I read her text, she said, "Girl, I creamed"
Man, I know she duckin' off with her side me
Who you know gon' hit it raw, baby, besides me?

We drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most

Inside the Mattress
73 ContributorsInside the Mattress Lyrics[Intro]
(Nard & B)
I pour out yellow tuss, I pour out yellow tuss
Cause I gotta have it
Yeah, Hendrix
I pour out yellow tuss, I pour out yellow tuss (TrenchWerk)
Cause I gotta have it
[Chorus]
Stacks hid inside the mattress
Racks hid inside the mattress
Packs hid inside the mattress
Ganks hid inside the mattress
Vert' dippin' through traffic
I'm gettin' better, I'm at practice
I'm workin' everyday, craftin'
I'm cool on her, I done had her
Bounce back with a millio'
Hit an island like Gilligan
Not just a regular civilian
I ride for the squad, I'm a champion
Remember we hit up the highway, we got us a stash spot
Remember as soon as we touch down, nigga cash out
[Verse 1]
I get on the stage and I rap 'til I pass out
Hit another city and another city, I'm just groovin'
I was tryna tell you I was losin'
I was gon' tell you I'm improvin'
I done caught a vibe, she was choosin'
Gotta keep my pride, I'm a general
Gotta keep it real with some criminals
Gotta keep my focus, I'm phenomenal
Once I cock and load I'm the money man
Got a hundred hoes, got a hundred Xans
We gon' party hard till the moon calls
She done fell in love with the mushrooms
And my college girls talkin' kung-fu
Put some cough syrup in a Mountain Dew
You would never see what I go through
Gotta keep my pride, I'm a general
Gotta keep it real with some criminals
Gotta take my time with these bad bitches
I don't wine and dine with no bad bitches
Send a flight for a bad bitch
Over night for a bad bitch
Cartier on a bad bitch
Cartier on a bad bitch

[Chorus]
Stacks hid inside the mattress
Racks hid inside the mattress
Packs hid inside the mattress
Ganks hid inside the mattress
Vert' dippin' through traffic
I'm gettin' better, I'm at practice
I'm workin' everyday, craftin'
I'm cool on her, I done had her
Bounce back with a millio'
Hit an island like Gilligan
Not just a regular civilian
I ride for my squad, I'm a champion
Remember we hit up the highway, we got us a stash spot
Remember as soon as we touch down, nigga cash out
[Verse 2]
I never told the world about you
I never told the homies 'bout you, not once
I never had no bitter towards you
I never had no drama for you, not once
I never want to go to none of these award shows
That's not me
Only the time will tell the day I prevail and get me a Grammy
Lil Mexico, kept it real from the start
If I did it for you it came from the heart
Came from the trenches and turned into art
I wake up and do it way better tomorrow
I wake up and cook up a kilo
Take a flight on a jet out to Rio
It's mafia all day
We come out the hallways
Murder in broad day, murder in broad day
Sit in the passenger side with the tool on my lap
Got lawyers and actresses and models pursuin' me now
Our foundation built on loyalty, you can't ruin me now

[Chorus]
Stacks hid inside the mattress
Racks hid inside the mattress
Packs hid inside the mattress
Ganks hid inside the mattress
Vert' dippin' through traffic
I'm gettin' better, I'm at practice

I'm cool on her, I done had her
Bounce back with a millio'
Hit an island like Gilligan

Remember we hit up the highway, we got us a stash spot
Remember as soon as we touch down, nigga cash out

I pour out yellow tuss, I pour out yellow tuss
Cause I gotta have it

Solitaires

(Wheezy outta here)
[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Solitary diamonds, solitary jewels
Way that bitch is shinin', lookin' like the moon
Said she wanna party, wanna let it loose
Bustin' out my Glock and sharin' all the loot
It's jumpin', let it in (Ooh)
I put it out, they come in (Ooh)
[Verse 1: Future & Travis Scott]
Came up off a brick
Bought a Richard Mille, my new watch don't tick
Drippin' in Louis V, made a movie, and Prada another film
It's the Don Dada, I stand this Lamborghini on one wheel
Twelve o'clock, and I got my gun clocked, and I'm on one pill
Monday all the way to Sunday, pick a time to drill
Gettin' my lettuce, I'm gettin' my paper, I'm gettin' my trees (Woo, woo)
One thousand percent, keep it one thousand with me (Woo, woo, yeah)
Started with my squad, so I can't chill
Money over bitches, gotta play the field
Coronavirus diamonds, you can catch the flu
Trap in bandos, walk in Jimmy Choo
Solitaries made a rockstar too (Ooh)
Solitary diamonds, I can show proof (Ooh)
That these bitches on me just like a pop group
I got racks on my mind and I can't lose (Yeah)
And I got solitary diamonds, solitary jewels
Watches full of baguettes, pockets full of blue (Yeah)
Solitary diamonds, solitary jewels
Girls gettin' naked in my swimming pool (Yeah)
I wanna take care you and your friends (Yeah)

[Refrain: Travis Scott]
Ooh
I put it out, they come in
Ooh (It's lit)
Radical decisions what we always choose
All the dogs is hungry and they sellin' food (Yeah)
Every time we do it, tend to hit the news
I don't want it if it's stiff or if that pussy loose
Runnin', know they gunnin' 'cause I got the juice
I been thuggin' since a youngin, brought that work to school
Floodin' all the hundreds, we done broke the pool
All this money bring the power, I didn't make the rules (Let's go)
[Verse 2: Future & Travis Scott]
Sipping on codeine got my screws loose
Making all this money got my screws loose (Yeah)
Ridin' Lamborghini made her pussy juicy
Grippin' on the wheel, playin' in her pussy
Diamonds on my neck been going crazy
I think I need to see a psychiatrist (Ooh)
Living in the streets and the gutter raised me
I know how to sell narcotics (Yeah)
[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
When they let us off of lock, man, we gon' make that shit pop
Been humpin' wifey for so long, she got a limp when she walk
Got seven drops in four spots, I get to pick where I live
In the back, they playin' twinsies like a Hugh Hefner zoovie
On my teeth, these diamonds twinkle, in her legs a jacuzzi
I be tweakin' every day, I got some screws missin'
I keep an Air Max pump on me, no, not my 270s (Yeah)
And they know just where I be, it's like I'm 713 (Yeah)
Havin' money on this side is not the conversation (Yeah, yeah)
Solitary diamonds for my dog inside, he waited, yeah (Straight up)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Future]
Solitary diamonds, solitary jewels
Way that bitch is shinin', lookin' like the moon
Said she wanna party, wanna let it loose
Bustin' out my Glock and sharin' all the loot
I wanna take care you and your friends (Ooh)
I put it out, they come in (Ooh)

(Wheezy outta here)
[Verse 1]
Sitting behind five percent, you can see the chinain
Lil' one going crazy, ready to sprrt for the ginang
If it wasn’t for Google, man that bitch wouldn't know my nickname
Dropped a Maybach truck on a watch and it was plain jane
Let the door swang, swang the door open, smell cocaine
Trafficking drug money and trap out this one lane
Stepped all in mud, this bitch can't wait to tie my shoelace
Oh, she don’t like girls, bet this money make a bitch so gay
[Chorus]
Money real long, big as King Kong when you make the trap go jump
Yellow wrist stones, canary yellow stones, I'm putting on that stuff
Digging in hеr back, pull out my money, make a bitch bust a nut
Came out thе bando just to buy diapers, had to hit me a lick
I bought the Tahoe from the trap money, haven't even seen a brick
Cocaine by the kilo, these days put it right on my wrist
You can still see the chain lit up sitting behind five percent
[Verse 2]
Every time I re-up, they gotta advance at least twenty M
I been getting richer and richer my whole career
Took the dope money, went and record a mixtape, it's rappers way out
Sitting on a bail toting a big K, ain't even got a couch
To Australia, I'm familiar, spent two million on a jet
In that dualie doing the dash, I let lil' dawg he hold a TEC
I got molly with the crystals, but I been back doing X
Got a Rolex on my wrist, this bitch cost 'bout a Corvette
Give these niggas a couple bands and hit your face and hit your chest
I was rolling off the pill, I should’ve never fucked the bitch
I got hoes these niggas married, I don’t let 'em go, they come through
I got fentanyl in my diamonds, I spend a nine on a pair of shoes
I don’t even care who these niggas shot at, ain't nan of 'em got murked
I got some real killers, they'll kill a nigga, then go and shoot up the hearse
You think a nigga like me give a fuck ’bout a nigga shooting up the church?
I gotta take this shit up with God 'cause I'm a god on the earth
I got this motherfuckin' new Benz, I ain't even drove it since it came out
Couple of bad bitches, they twins, walkin' naked through my house
Cook good dope up in the kitchen, I could do that top chef
Bitches still claiming me, I ain't fucked in over a year

[Chorus]
Cartier wrist, Cartier watch, Cartier diamond buff
Money real long, big as King Kong when you make the trap go jump
Yellow wrist stones, canary yellow stones, I'm putting on that stuff
Digging in her back, pull out my money, make a bitch bust a nut
Came out the bando just to buy diapers, had to hit me a lick

They walk up on you, give it to your friends, nigga
They walk up on you, give it to you, see your friends, nigga

Yeah, we've been at the laundromat all day
We've been washin' money all day
I heard the police lookin' for me, 'cause I got the hood hot
We've been at the laundromat all day
We've been washin' money all day
I heard the police lookin' for me, 'cause I got the hood hot

They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up
That Easter Pink, I tried to give it up, I can't give it up
[Verse 1]
Twenty-eight grams, I serve it on the porch
I just seent them narcs, they ran off in my house
The homicide unit comin' to the house
My cousin murked a nigga and he just got out
I hang with all the killers and the robbers
I pour me up some drank, say "Fuck my problems"
My hood, they treat me, like I'm El Chapo
I keep that dog food, like I'm Ralo
I had the warrant in Clayco and beat the case
Man, I'm fresh as hell, bitch, Easter day
All my ghetto tactics, I'm above average
I've been so in tune, man, I've been so ambitious
Grab another Fanta, let me fill it up
If they ain't make the channel, you ain't built like us
The Federales fuckin' with my nigga Ty
It's Black Amigo Gang 'til a nigga die
I feel I'm walkin' through Hell
I swear to God I'll never tell
They try to give a nigga the chair
I tell my mama, "Wish me well"

They got girl on the money and I still count it
They got boy on the money, watch my nigga count it

I took the mack in Bal Harbor, niggas ain't slippin', we got 'em
I took the pack out to Paris, me and that money got married
Me and the molly got married
Devoted in everything, my niggas mean everything (Zaytoven)

Yeah, we tryna get it
Ask me, do I know how to whip it
Yeah, fuck the witness
[Chorus 1]
It got blood on the money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up
That Easter Pink, I tried to give it up, I can't give it up

[Verse 3]
She put me off and it was ugly
I made a million dollars, say she love me
The way she did me, it destroyed me
I kept it real with lil' shorty
I've been goin' bar for bar, these niggas know what's poppin' with me
I can go from car to car, these bitches quarter million at least
Two thousand for the shoes, I keep some shit on my feet
I'm probally in the mood to fuck your bitch on the beach
I dropped out of school and I get money like Meech
Send a junkie, send a driver just to get somethin' to eat
You see how things change?
I came from cocaine
[Chorus 1]
It got blood on the money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up
That Easter Pink, I tried to give it up, I can't give it up
[Outro]
I hang with all the killers and the robbers
I pour me up a drink, say, "Fuck my problems"
The federales fuckin' with my nigga Ty
It's Black Amigo Gang 'til a nigga die
I heard the police lookin' for me, 'cause I got the hood hot
Heard the police lookin' for me, 'cause I got the hood
They got girls on the money and I still count it
They got boy on the money, watch my nigga count it

See through the ice in this platinum, I did a one-eighty, I went up the wrong way
Look at the bezel, it twinkle and glisten and shine, you gon' need you some sunblock
Thousands of grams on grams and certified stones, it came on a timeclock
All of my whoadies coyotes, we stickin' together, we comin' like shottas
Put a tracker on that bitch if you love her, 'cause she comin' through like a goon squad
I put it on, then it's over, I got different designers all over
Coupes on coupes, chop the top off the Rolls-Royce truck, you know it's gon' be over
Bitch do whatever I say, she on front line, come through like a soldier
[Verse 1: Future]
Now that you got my attention, you 'bout to get put on suspension if I see the greed
Like I'm a part of the lynching, got twenty-one chains on my neck, had to go Dominique
Drinkin' codeine and roll up a leaf, I fuck on his bitch, now she so bossy
Stella McCartney, I'm drippin' so nerdy, my fit was a birdie alone, that was it
Talk a few bales, oh yeah, that's it
Burnin' down Rodeo, oh yeah, that's it
I could put it on a scale, oh yeah, that's it
Ballin' in Chanel, like a player, that's it
Rainbow Rollie, oh no, that's it
Got a bisexual girl, that's it
Do it professional, girl, that's it
Treat me like a mayor, oh yeah, that's it

Put her on a jet at the Clear, that's it
She got no face, and for me, that's it (That's it)
I'm pulling her hair every time, that is it (That's it)
She don't wear no underwear in my crib (My crib)
Every time I'm in it, you know I'm gon' slip (Gon' slip)
Touchin' on the water, start matching my wrist (Woah, woah)
Off an X pill, look like Exorcist (Off an X pill)
I ain't never tell her was ready for this, that's it (Me and Wheezy, that's the wave)

I been waking up to bitches in my hotel suite
We been gone on the molly
Holding onto Friday
Why you looking at me shawty
Recognizing I'm the only, only, only one that's ballin'
Only one that’s ballin'
Only one who’s going out the country
Gotta keep a translator for the models
Only one, I’m only reppin' fly shit only
Keep some fly shit on me, keep a fly bitch on me

[Verse 1]
My trainers are matching my jacket
I’m strapped with that ratchet
I’m strapped with that Bape and that ape
I’m gone off these medicals, gone off these medicals
Maybe one day I'ma get out the drank
And maybe one day we can fuck in the bank
I made me a Porsche out of two and a quarter
I got to Morocco and lay in some foreigns
Then I come back to Onyx and find me that one I can fuck on
And touch on and turn up and turn on
We don’t watch TV, we count Fettuccine
4 and a half, it’s right under my beanie
I made me some snaps then I fucked on a genie
Put her in a cab and I jumped in a 'Ghini
You gon’ need yellow tape when I step on the scene
When you send me an invite, I come with a biznite
She wrapped up in plastic, got coke in the mattress
All of this shit is about living lavish
This money, these cars, and these bitches, these carats
These radical styles, I’ma give you a style
You can take it, your new style ain't gon' make you a pile
[Pre-Chorus]
I been waking up to bitches in my hotel suite

Light skinned bone the same color macaroni
Put her hair in a pony, hit a note like Toni
I know you hoes been lonely, now I’m back on my lonely
And I'm back how you want it, and I'm back and I want it
Made a film like Sony, fuck the fake and the phony
I gots cake in the morning, I rock Adidas and Margielas
I be staying at the telly, eat a sandwich out the deli
And my life is like Belly, young Future, sincerely
[Pre-Chorus]

Accepting My Flaws
66 ContributorsAccepting My Flaws Lyrics[Interlude]
Was there to see all of the real raw shit, but you ain't stay
Well, I got— kept it all to myself, you know what I mean? Haha
It's understandable
You know exactly who a motherfucker is, dawg
You know what I'm saying?
You know exactly who a motherfucker is
You could've been right here with a motherfucker, but you ain't wanna be right here with a motherfucker
How the fuck you gon' look at me now and try to holler at me like we motherfuckin' friends?
You know we ain't no motherfuckin' friends
[Intro]
Yeah, nigga
You know how I fuckin' get it
I know I ain't perfect, you know what I'm sayin'?
Perfect
That's my rider, nigga (808 Mafia)
Shawty, ride with me
[Chorus]
Lord, forgive me, I've been on a rampage
Grim Reaper ridin' in the Rolls Royce, yeah, yeah
Spent a day to sober up, then I popped me one up
I can't pop up when I want with her, she popular
I've been tryna fight my demons, I've been tryna fight my cup
I always tell her she my therapy, I told her it was rough
She acceptin' all my flaws, I got diamonds with the cut
I've been sufferin' withdrawals, missin' out on real love

[Verse]
Different, you a angel, true to me
They gon' try to convince me that it's different
But I know, it's in my spirit and I can feel it, yeah
She don't bring up when these bitches bein' miserable and typical
Take my blood, baby, we goin' digital
Thousand dollar ski boots by Perry Ellis
And I don't plan on taking no ski trip, they ain't even drip (Woo)
Chanel fanny pack out in Egypt, ain't no reason
Gucci bucket hat for all my heathens
Temporary distractions, ain't no grievin' 'cause they reachin'
Copy and they clone what I'm feedin', they be thievin'
China white in my home, be strategic, I got Fiji
Grind up on my own 'cause I see how they mistreat me
Don't you let 'em turn you on me, I see it, I can peep it
Clear like white Patron, I can see it, you conceited
Talkin' on the phone, you can hear my tone, mischievous
Plastic or the chrome, whatever we need to keep us heated
Canary yellow stone, girl, shine on my demons
I feel it in my bones when you takin' out my semen
I purchased a couple Cashmere sweaters this evening
Take you for a walk in the park like a deacon
Half a ticket, pullin' up on you and mamacita
Give you the keys in her face to show her how I treat you
I'm takin' you out on dinner dates, got Franklins like Aretha
Trained in the warzone, codeine in my one liter
Pain in my attitude, it's vicious and it's lethal
Came off the avenue and ran into a diva
Broken-hearted, baby had me down, had to get you
You out the garden, baby, I'm from the jungle with the leeches
Clouded my lungs up and I slowly started speakin'
Rain, thunderin', showin' you grace for this meetin'
Givin' you compliments throughout the day and the weekend
Fall in love with revenge, hopin' that'll kill my demons
Sittin' out on my porch, I'm in disbelief
Give me glory, give me Lori, that's victory
Moment I drop your name, is it chemistry?
Fuck this money and fame if it's meant to be
Like a rock star showin' up at a symphony
Rock hard, pissin' on my enemy
Fuck 'em all, we don't show 'em sympathy
Her favorite color blue, I bought her Tiffany
Out the trap spot, I got my dope degree
They persuaded me, they gon' try to persuade you to leave
Had laid in it, played in it, and stayed in it for weeks
Mistakes like earthquakes, they can't break us a piece
I'm not Catholic but had to have a talk with the priest
Acrobatic flips, gettin' European cash 'cross the sea
It's so radical, automatic-al, I'm knowin' we elite
Fascinated by the lifestyle, you know it bring greed
Fascinated by your feistiness, okay
Fascinated over your crisis, it's warfare
When we roll one, we converse, we like orphans
Coast to coast, float the ocean like a starfish
Check my post, I'ma toast to the heartless
That's why I'm prayin' for better days on this continent
I don't need a ghost to write my promises
You boost my confidence

[Chorus]
Lord, forgive me, I've been on a rampage
Grim Reaper ridin' in the Rolls Royce, yeah, yeah
Spent a day to sober up, then I popped me one up
I can't pop up when I want with her, she popular
I've been tryna fight my demons, I've been tryna fight my cup
I always tell her she my therapy, I told her it was rough
She acceptin' all my flaws, I got diamonds with the cut
I've been sufferin' withdrawals, missin' out on real love

Last Breath
42 ContributorsLast Breath Lyrics[Produced by Ludwig Göransson & Metro Boomin]
[Intro]
I was so hardheaded at first
My grandma didn't even believe in me
I kept goin' though
All I can say is I told you
Jewelry at the bank now in the vault
You should've never doubted me
I'ma work 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
Yeah you should've never doubted me
The pain and the struggle followed me
My daddy never been there, bothered me
And these cold streets made a man of me
Know a time, it'll come, they doubt me
Had to keep them OGs 'round me
Keep a young, young homie grounded
You never know where your motivation'll come from
We do the most for these broads and pop Chandon
They try to push you aside, you gotta fight some
I had it on the dot and now we ride guns
I want that number one spot, I'm like icon
I got that beast in my eyes, I'm like Tyson
With my heart and my drive, I know I'm righteous
Keep some ice on me, Rocky, Rocky like Balboa
Once you win, win, win you gon' want more
Set a trend, trend, trend, need an encore
I was down on my last when I found myself
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath

[Hook]
I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath

I got love all around me, yeah, yeah
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath
[Verse 2]
I came from them quarter waters
Every nigga in my gang unemployed
You fuckin' 'round, you must want a gang war
I got ol' girl, then I transport her
Trappin' is a habit, I got Xans on me
I'm hotter than a flame, keep the fan on me
Catch me whippin', I'm Hussein with them bands on me
I'ma kill the competition and I'm playin' for keeps
You see water drippin' off me then catch it
I turned nothin' into somethin', now I'm livin'
You neglected me, you know you shouldn't have did that
They was countin' me out, you know you shouldn't have did that
You didn't recognize my drive, shouldn't have did that
Now I'm flyin' every day, I won't get back
I just wanna be the champ for the misfits
And the ones that would say I couldn't do it

[Hook]
I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath
I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath
[Bridge]
Who knew I would take it to a whole 'nother level
Who knew I've been racin' with a whole 'nother rebel
Shawty wasn't checkin' for me, mama wasn't checkin' for me
I hustle every day just so I can spend a check on you
You my dawg 'til the end, I got so much respect for you
I watched you give up on me, but I never lost faith, did I?
You didn't ever hold me down, then I bought a new safe, didn't I?
Paper plates flushin' in that Wraith, didn't I?
I'm built with a new reputation
Blood, sweat and tears are my new foundation
Obama on my main line, I could run the nation
[Hook]
I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath
I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath

[Outro]
I got tears in my eyes
My dreams all I got and I'll die for it
If I love it with a passion, I'ma ride for it

Tony Montana

Fuckin' cockroaches
Muthafuckin' Freebandz
Want me to be the bad guy?
Wanna fuckin' play?
Ya know?
Come on!
It's the Cartel, nigga!
[Chorus: Future]
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up on my ends
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take 'em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
[Verse 1: Future]
I take over the streets, fresh off the banana boat
I come straight from the east, where niggas split your cantaloupe
You tell me where you wanna meet, I'm comin' with a gang of dope
My cigar full of loud, I'm laced up to the fuckin' fo'
A Porsche Carrera, Panamera, 911
I do the whole dash, droppin' all cash (Woah)
Gutter to the death of me, I'm stickin' to the recipe
Plugged in with Colombians, I know Sosa
All I got is my balls and my word, fuck the roaches
Everything we do, we put Versace on the sofas
The money got me geeked like I took a hit of coca
My life is a movie, I gotta stay focused

[Chorus: Future]
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up on my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana (Who you)
[Verse 2: Drake]
On the hood you see the Stallion, passenger a stallion
Niggas gettin' nervous, I'm passin' out the Valium
I suggest you pop it, but please don't get too sleepy
Used to have them bitches twerkin' up in 400 West Peachtree
Bet you those same hoes'll see me, be like that's how you feelin'?
Used to stay up at The Twelve, now you're worth like 12 million
Boy, you did it, boy, you did it, you did the unexpected
I say fuck the unexpected, I just did what I projected
I swear young women are lost these days while older women dig me
Fuckin' women that knew Biggie, so it really ain't no biggie
It's just OVO and XO, and Freebandz the committee
And shout out to Toronto, bitch, I'm Tony in my city, huh
[Chorus: Future]
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up on my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

[Verse 3: Future]
Another shot of Quelo, she'll be comin' back to pesos
When you're plugged in with Pedro, it's hard for hoes to let go
See AK's ain't no bitch, nigga, I'll split your tato
Ain't nothin' about me ordinary, I come with the yayo
I move like a mob boss, it's gon' take an army
The world is mine, nigga, you get it if you want it
You fuckin' with me, you'll move to Alaska by the mornin'
You want me to be the bad guy? Okay, it's on then
Champagne spillin', crab cakes everywhere
My white bitch trippin', she say I ain't playin' fair
I'm about to cop a tiger, and put it in the car seat
Freebandz a company, so, nigga, it don't matter, ayy

Shit, we gon' do this shit right
Get in first-line, let it take off
You made it brine then I take off
[Chorus: Kanye West & Future]
Cross me so much, I got nails in my hand
City on fire
City on fire (Last time, yeah, yeah)
City on fire (I got you)
(ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Comin' from the 'Raq, the home of the drillers
I'ma buy a home next to your home if I miss you
Rubbin' on your ass, but your mouth is the issue
When you run for '24, I bet your spouse gon' be with you
Who put this together? Me, that's who
"We did it, Joe," but what they really do?
Save the pep talk, and the TED Talk (Ye)
I'm 'bout to set it off (Ye), I'm 'bout to set it off (Ye)
Somebody said he off (Ye), well, let me get this off (Ye)
Visionary thoughts (Ye) 'fore I could barely talk (Ye)
Mind runnin' laps (Ye) 'fore I could barely walk (Ye)
They say we never make it (Ye), that's what you thought (Ye)

[Chorus: Kanye West & Future]
Cross me so much I got nails in my hand
City on fire (Yeah, Pluto)

Cookin' out the Pyrex
City on fire (Never had a doubt on the shit but I told you)
City on fire (Nigga, I'ma bring it, I'ma, ah, ah)
City on fire
[Verse 2: Future]
Cookin' out the bowl, tryna scrape out the paint
One day I was high, had to pour the whole pint
Woke up in the sky, same money from the bank
I'll take it wrapped in plastic, accept anything
Cut up the dark with the fetti, nine times
Doped up today like I got ninety-nine lives
Blood on my money, see the blood in my eyes
LaFerrari, buy them, two at a time
Every time I fuck, you gotta tell me it's mine
Sinnin' again, I've been winnin' again
Tray done got shot, he back spinnin' again
Ridin' with the fire, bitch ain't never gon' see
Walkin' in the day one in the head is a must
Dark in my flesh, say it run in my cup
Rose gold like a Band-Aid over my cut
Tailored in plush and covered up all this kush

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Cross me so much, I got nails in my hand
City on fire, like Bethlehem
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Testin' my faith and I fell in a trance
Blessings on blessings, they fell in my hand
Comin' from the 'Raq, we the home of the drillers
Comin' from the hundreds, you got change for a billion?
Comin' for the house, real change in a minute
When I run for '24, I know my spouse better be with me
Hundred feet tall when I stand on the business
Look at how we did everything we intended
You don't want no tension, boy, you just want attention
I'ma pop up at your house if you pop up in my mentions
[Verse 4: Future]
Got a bando, count money with a MAC
Seen too much violence, done seen too much death
Bodies on bodies, got a gang full of them
Raised by gangsters, prostitutes and pimps
Visit my grandmother in prison on Sunday
Talk in third person, they won't admit it if I done it
Money like sage in my house, keep it burnin'
Money like sage in my house, keep it burnin'

[Outro: Kanye West & Future]
City on fire
Money like sage in my house, keep it burnin'
City on fire
Money like sage in my house, keep it burnin'

I should pimp this bitch and make her pay me (Yeah)

Started off surfin' on a codeine wave
I don't exchange info with these niggas
They some opps, you can kill 'em, they ain't with us

Got a line on good Gelato and Gorilla
Got Lil Freaky with me, know you gon' get hit up
Steppin' over dead bodies in Margielas (Oh yeah)
I touched a hundred M's and I've been gettin' better (Ooh)
In a red Bugatti, gave it right to valet
Shoot his head off right, it get you new Chanaynay
Shootin' dice all night, yeah, me and Dae Dae
We had to work the one on 'em, it was a good payday
He was a teenager, they put him on the news where I'm from
He let off forty shots, he can't get no bond
Closed on when he shoppin', when he kill him, he young
They ever get caught snitchin', they gon' cut off your tongue (Mm)

Get the backend at the door and let the dogs kill 'em (Dogs)
Point 'em out, then turn around, that's how we let 'em in (Ooh)
Paranoid, one conversation, then I switch the SIM (Oh)
This took like NBA business, I ain't talkin' scrimmage (In the league)
You know I'm James Bond with it, Harden with the finish
New whip's got curtain options in it, I don't need it tinted (Yeah)
Just need the option not to see 'em when I'm ridin' in it (Yeah)
Used to spend checks on my Nikes, now they pay me (Yeah, yeah)

Southside on the track, yeah
Haha
We just choppin' it up
Yeah

Take it out the bank, go put it up
Got my main ho put up
Straight off the lot, go put it up
My last two foreigns pulled up
Straight out the bank, go put it up
Everybody in the hood gon' pull up
I got 'em on Xans and the Roxies
The homie done ran with the thotties
Every week I change my closet
Got a Fendi store in my house
Got a Bentley garage in my house
Got a watch on my wrist, cost a house
My bitch can't sleep at my house
Make her sleep at a hotel now
And when you talk, man, you talkin' all cap
And your diamonds, they lookin' like tap
I was always duckin' from the paps
Keep an R&B bitch in my lap
Out in Beverly Hills, I adapt
But I still had to ride with that strap

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Yellow diamonds like banana, that's cap
Put some dirt in Mello Yello, no cap
Rockin' Maison Margielas, that's cap
Red bitch, Cinderella, no cap
I can turn perro
I can turn petrol
Bad bitch out a ghetto
East Lake Meadows
I was 'bout to get better
Still trappin', fuck Berettas
Rolls Royce umbrella
Gettin' dome at Coachella
Yeah, hop out the coupe and titty-fuck her
Yeah, free Bobby Shmurda, motherfuck the Rikers
I'ma lean back in the 'Bach, she suck like lolli-suckers
I lied when I said I love her
Backstabbed the bitch, like I'm Myer Michaels
[Verse 3: Future]
My lil' blooda keep a stick on the seat
He gon' brrrt, brrrt, brrrt 'til your heart stop beat
I'm a Zone 6 nigga and I'm riding in a foreign
Fuck a bad yellow bitch anytime I get bored, nigga, huh
I'm a giant on these streets, nigga, huh
Switch my bitch once a week, nigga, huh
One-point-five in my Goyard, huh
Gon' need a way bigger surfboard, huh
I bust down my plain Yachtmaster with bezels
I flew her out to Vegas, swear to God, forgot to hit her
I made 'em quit they jobs, then I gave 'em to my niggas
I gave her a little start-up money and put her in a rental
I send my Ethiopian to go pray at the temple
I flood her heart with diamonds, just to pray, it's so expensive
She tastin' holy water, so for me, it's beneficial
She caught the holy ghost when I gave her the Presidential

How It Was

This is an experience
If you haven't been a part of nothing this great
We went through motherfuckin', the unbelievable
[Chorus]
Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine
And I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud
That's how it was
Last night we made a movie, I'ma tell you how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was
[Verse 1]
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it
I was self motivated, I was self driven
I got my determination, now I'm really winnin'
We could pull up Maseratis, I done whipped the Benzes
I was handin' thousands out when I go shop at Lenox
When it come to stackin' cash up, it ain't no limit
I got racks on top of racks and I ain't talking tennis
It's some girls that's gone wild, I like to see them kissin'
It's some niggas playing foul and they sneak dissin'
I won't let her hold me back to complete my mission
It ain't easy when you try to make it out the trenches

[Chorus]
Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine
And I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud

How it was, nigga, how it was

[Verse 2]
I'm the dope man, dope man, yes I am
Turned your baby mama house into a drug lab
I was using all the forks, using all the pans
She done seen a lot of money touch a nigga hands
Saw me microwaving dope, like some leftovers
Drugged in with the green grow, a lawn mower
I’m a Michael Fox, George Jetson, Elroyer
I'm a space cadet, an astronaut, a rockstar
I was trapped in the trap, dodging cop cars
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Jupiter, and Mars
You ain't foreign, it's okay, I like all broads
I'ma hustle everyday so I don't never starve

[Chorus]
Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine
And I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud

How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was
[Verse 3]
Serve it to you cleaner than the house keeper
Cruisin' by the scene with a street sweeper
Pour a half a pint of codeine in a two liter
Scorchin' hot flame, all that Future drop is heaters
I put passion in my lyrics and I'm working, nigga
Got a dogfood connect; DMX, nigga
Got a styrofoam cup, and I'm doubled up
Think I'm Usain Bolt, ran my bands up
Ain't no pressure on my money, ‘cause I'm certified
All these diamonds 'round my neck, it got em mesmerized
All these drugs inside my system got me super high
Posted up and servin' junkies, been a long time

[Chorus]
Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine
And I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud
That's how it was
Last night we made a movie, I'ma tell you how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was

When I was just smashing her, she seen the bands
Her body Coca-Cola and she seen a can
The Glock was still on me while we was romancin' (Woo)
Think I fell in love with this girl, came from France (Woo)
She caramel without getting a tan (Hold on)

Shawty got more bags than a drug dealer, wait (Shawty got, shawty got more bags)

Had to get a penthouse just for the freaks
So they can all come sleep with us
We don't do nothing that's normal
Everything we do is super gigantic (Pluto)
We don't put on fugazi
Everything we wear is super titanic (Pluto)
I just caught me a wave (Wave)
Feel like a nigga done jumped in Atlantic (I did it)
One hell of a car collection (Collection)
Pulling it up, it's panoramic (Skrrt-skrrt)
Picked her up in a Cayenne
Soon as she got in she ain't have nothing on (Skrrt-skrrt)

We met through a mutual friend
We started clubbing, dranking, talking, laughing and grinning
You had your eyes on me the whole time
I could see ya through my lens
Your face your shape and the lil things about ya…had the kid all in
Anytime we spend time, we spend more than we spend benjamins
What the fuck this high siddity girl want to do with an astronaut kid…
Or asking myself questions, I had to understand…
You gotta live and learn to make mistakes to be the man
We didn't mean for it to get this serious...
I got another nigga bitch with me
And I’m falling for her, yeah I’m falling for her
We ain’t got no strings attached

I see you jocking me, and I’m jocking you harder
You got everything a woman want, I still want to spoil ya
And your loyalty to him ain't my concern cause you’re loyal
It's like we been casted with a spell or both ate some poison
Tell him I ain't mean to intervene with his main thing
You my main fling, I took it main stream
Everyday its nice to share our main dreams, and ain't a damn thing
Will never come between, our thing
And we ain’t mean for it to be this serious
I made a promise to you and I’ma take it serious
Cause I know my words mean the most to you
And you mean the most to me
We got a special relation, can't nobody come between

Last Name
48 ContributorsLast Name Lyrics[Intro: Future]
This ain't a diss song, this a real song (DY Krazy)
Nigga, we ain't runnin' from no responsibilities
I take care of families
I'm embarrassed over this mess that I done caused
[Chorus: Future]
I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile
[Verse 1: Future]
Gotta keep it stashed up for the trial
Material intentions, gotta play it foul
I'm in rare form like a hyena runnin' wild
All the opps gettin' gunned down
[Chorus: Future]
I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I lost connections to the streets and I was in denial
I seen a grown man shed tears 'cause he lost his trial
I saved the streets, a crazy feeling just to lose a child
Have a one-on-one with God, yeah, it been a while
I woke up paranoid off drugs, I said, "I'm tired now"
I answer my phone in the middle of the night, like, "Who done died now?"
Knowin' I'm involved, but we gon' slide back when it's dyin' down
I don't know who opps no more, you look crazy, I'm firin' rounds
I love the streets, it's a portion of me
I came from nothin' to the voice of the streets
I got blood in the streets
The way he died, I advise he died in his sleep
That's the trenches, yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Future]
I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile
[Verse 3: Future]
Public conversation got you touchin' clouds
Popped the wrong pill, hit the wrong dial
Ain't no visitation, waitin' for the trial (Ain't no visitation)
Took my last name, this ain't 'bout the child (Woah)
Real classy Jazzy, real don't do no trollin'
Gotta treat you like you dead when you playin' bogus

[Verse 4: Lil Durk]
See, Pluto, you my brother, gotta stay focused
Sometimes I get in my feelings, too, I wish I wore a Trojan
They tryna go viral off DMs, that's why I'm antisocial
I'm just tryna teach the killers not to use emotion
I got a whole bitch, don't think about my old bitch
I'm just tryna live my life and catch this moment, yeah
[Chorus: Future]
I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile
[Outro: Future]
We can't even get no sleep behind this shit
You make a temporary decision
That cause permanent pain
Shit ain't goin' nowhere (I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides)
That hood mentality feel like you can go through anything, nigga (Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile)

Transformer, I just popped a transformer
Lit the room up, all I did was hold my arm up
Went through Barneys, I spent 20k on Amiris
Got my weight up, now I'm talkin' back to Siri
Smashin' foreigners, murder shit at the coroner
Jackie Joyner, racin' racks all summer
Woke the don up, all I did was hold my arm up
Top goin' up, it look like I lit the sun up
[Verse 1: Future]
Goin bonkers, I fuck with her, I'm her sponsor
Go redundant, everything I do responsive
Off the continent, everything is out the country
No assumption, hit on the gas, start punchin'
Park my confidence, hit the gas, barely functionin'
Ain't no consciousness, I'm bout to spaz on this stallion
Fuck a casualty, everything we did was lavishly
Fuck a tragedy, all these sticks automatically
[Chorus: Future]
Transformer, I just popped a transformer
Lit the room up, all I did was hold my arm up

What the fuck, I'ma have to pump brakes on these hoes
Real shooters, I don't ever pump fake on these hoes

Always eatin' Japanese so I'm a need wasabi dip
Four—four—four albums in, pull a milli' for a show
While these bitches is servin' Milli Vanilli on the low
Spent my money on some dope, where my money envelope?
Transform it to a Billy 'cause I really am the goat (Really am the goat)
Transformer, I just popped a transformer
Master bathroom, two jacuzzis and a sauna
They ain't warn her, now she out here facin' karma
Had a chance, but got at me now she's a goner
Where my bad bitches? Fuck these niggas, give them trauma
Coulda fixed his life but now that nigga need Iyanla
All his friends tryna kill it, eat it J.A. Dahmer
Niggas snakes but, stupid, I'm the snake charmer
This a different tax bracket, upper echelon
I'm still the bad guy, I am a Decepticon
Some call me Nicki but some call me Megatron
I'm stoppin' bags and I don't need a red octagon

Thousand carats, ooh, nigga, Roger Rabbit
Where the towel, bitch? Ooh, we just fucked a balance
Check my standings, ooh, I just bought a palace
Shawty baddest, ooh, and she from a pageant
Fuck a daddy, ooh, 'cause she call me "Zaddy"
'Cause she call—, 'cause she call me "Zaddy"

(Zaytoven)
I gotta kick this flavor, you heard?
Ah, that boy Steezy
That's his bitch
It's only Mexico 'round a nigga, feel me, you heard?
[Chorus]
You're chewing on bars, then they call you barbarian
All I see is stars, fly a bitch out from Maryland
Molly on file and I'm sipping out the styrofoam
Cooking up dope, got more fish than aquarium
Bend it over, pose for a Freebandz president
I'm counting up 'cho while I'm counting up these presidents
Slide down on a new diva, that's what we about
Riding 'round with a two-liter, I'm so poured up
Two-seater plush, few racks in the bumper
A few goons in the cut, I treat 'em just like brothers
Treat 'em just like brothers, treat 'em just like brothers
Few goons in the cut, treat 'em just like brothers
[Verse 1]
Chewing on the bars, and we call 'em barbarian
I'm on my way to Mars, got the stars in the ceiling
Down south, Georgia, boy, we the new Chopper City
We the new Chopper City, we the new Chopper City, yeah
Free B.G.
Word to my youngin, we gon' dump on you
That dirty money, I can smell the gunpowder
That's dirty money, I can smell the gunpowder
He got his hoodie with his hand in his right pocket
And you gotta watch out or it's lights out
Lights out, hotwire me an Eddie Bauer
And I went and got it poppin', and I let them bullets shower

[Chorus]
You're chewing on bars, then they call you barbarian
All I see is stars, fly a bitch out from Maryland
Molly on file and I'm sipping out the styrofoam
Cooking up dope, got more fish than aquarium
Bend it over, pose for a Freebandz president
I'm counting up 'cho while I'm counting up these presidents
Slide down on a new diva, that's what we about
Riding 'round with a two-liter, I'm so poured up
Two-seater plush, few racks in the bumper
A few goons in the cut, I treat 'em just like brothers
Treat 'em just like brothers, treat 'em just like brothers
Few goons in the cut, treat 'em just like brothers
[Verse 2]
Off two milligrams, I forgot about my ex-ho ('Bout my ex-ho)
Stayin' with the gas, fill my blunts up with petrol (Blunts up with petrol)
Pop a couple double G's and down 'em with some XO (Down 'em with some XO)
Trippin' off them bars, you forgot when you was dead broke (yeah)
Styrofoams and mula, yeah, styrofoams and mula (Freebandz)
Half a million dollars on a ring, I'm taking Percocets
Down five Xanax and I pray I wake up and forget
I been with the gang 'cause they love me how I am
Shit ain't been the same, they talkin' 'bout me on the 'Gram
They say I turned my back on my baby mama, I'm on them tabs
And my hood looking up to me, I love them niggas to death
Even in the afterlife, when ain't a breath of me left

[Chorus]
You're chewing on bars, then they call you barbarian
All I see is stars, fly a bitch out from Maryland
Molly on file and I'm sipping out the styrofoam
Cooking up dope, got more fish than aquarium
Bend it over, pose for a Freebandz president
I'm counting up 'cho while I'm counting up these presidents
Slide down on a new diva, that's what we about
Riding 'round with a two-liter, I'm so poured up
Two-seater plush, few racks in the bumper
A few goons in the cut, I treat 'em just like brothers
Treat 'em just like brothers, treat 'em just like brothers
Few goons in the cut, treat 'em just like brothers
[Outro]
He got his hoodie with his hand in his right pocket
And you gotta watch out or it's lights out
Lights out, hotwire me an Eddie Bauer
And I went and got it poppin', and I let them bullets shower

When I Was Broke
49 ContributorsWhen I Was Broke Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, she ain't leave when I was broke
I used to sit at the trap all day and wait for a phone call
She ain't leave when I was broke
Juggin' and finessin'
She ain't leave when I was broke
Yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
I had to climb out the sewer
Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'
Hold me down
Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it
Sometimes I try to be there for you
And my plan, it don't go like I want it
Watch me roll this dope, watch me
Hit the trap and load this gun, watch me
[Chorus]
She ain't leave when I was broke
She ain't leave when I was broke
(She ain't leave when I was broke)
One thing that she didn't do
She ain't leave when I was broke (she ain't leave)
Don't ever tell her what I go through
But how she act, I know she know
I can see you was givin' up
And that's what killed me the most

[Verse 1]
Came out the sewer, it's stankin'
Go in the booth and I'm blankin'
Slept with my tool on the blanket
Like I'm the son of Michael
All of these haters, they're gettin' spiteful
They see my heart has been damaged
You see the whip Panoramic
You see I made it, you witnessed progression
I was talkin' like I knew I was destined
I'm a boss and I won't ever regret it
Whether you like it, you gotta admit it
Didn't I change up your location?
Didn't I pull up in that Wraith?
Have I fulfilled all your dreams?
I gave you checks
So you're checkin' it off on your wish list
You get Ferraris right now
We doin' Cali right now (without a doubt)
[Pre-Chorus]
I had to climb out the sewer
Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'
Hold me down
Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it
Sometimes I try to be there for you
And my plan, it don't go like I want it
Watch me roll this dope, watch me
Hit the trap and load this gun, watch me

[Chorus]
She ain't leave when I was broke
She ain't leave when I was broke
(She ain't leave when I was broke)
One thing that she didn't do
She ain't leave when I was broke (she ain't leave)
Don't ever tell her what I go through
But how she act, I know she know
I can see you was givin' up
And that's what killed me the most
[Verse 2]
We goin' shoppin' right now, I see they copy right now
I see they're watchin' right now
They didn't know I was just plottin' right now
I've been executin' the play for a while
Witnessed Chubbie Baby walk down the aisle
I got a few rings on me now
Had to change my team and my style
You can't intervene on my craft
You better turn your back right now
Ain't no turnin' back right now
I can't let you cramp my style
If you ain't blink then you lookin' like an owl
Stand right back 'cause you lookin' like coward
You end up stiff, sleepin' with the flowers (ditch)
She understand everything I go through
Gutta nigga always

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to climb out the sewer
Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'
Hold me down
Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it
Sometimes I try to be there for you
And my plan, it don't go like I want it
Watch me roll this dope, watch me
Hit the trap and load this gun, watch me
[Chorus]
She ain't leave when I was broke
She ain't leave when I was broke
(She ain't leave when I was broke)
One thing that she didn't do
She ain't leave when I was broke (she ain't leave)
Don't ever tell her what I go through
But how she act, I know she know
I can see you was givin' up
And that's what killed me the most
[Outro]
One thing that she didn't do
She ain't leave when I was broke
She ain't leave when I was broke
She ain't leave when I was broke
One thing that she didn't do
She ain't leave when I was broke
