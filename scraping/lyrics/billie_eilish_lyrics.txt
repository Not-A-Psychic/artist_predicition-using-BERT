But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Wish I could explain it better

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

[Verse 2]
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
[Verse 3]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
[Outro]
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
[Chorus]
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?

And time breaks your heart

Only made us closer until July

Somebody write down the recipe
Been tryin' hard not to overeat

When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Not today, maybe tomorrow
[Chorus]
Open up the door, can you open up the door?

Do you feel it too?
When you told me it was serious
Were you serious? Mm
They told me they were only curious
Now it's serious, mm

Open up the door, can you open up the door?

Animals, evidence

Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters

Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow

I try (I'm not what) to live in black and white, but I'm so blue (But I'm not what you need)
I'd like (Not what you need) to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true, true
And I'm still so bluе (And it's not true)
I'm true blue, truе blue
I'm true blue

[Part II: BORN BLUE]
[Intro]
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
[Verse 1]
You were born bluer than a butterfly
Beautiful and so deprived of oxygen
Colder than your father's eyes
He never learned to sympathize with anyone
[Chorus]
I don't blame you
But I can't change you
Don't hate you (Don't hate you)
But we can't save you (But we can't save you)
[Verse 2]
You were born reachin' for your mother's hands
Victim of your father's plans to rule the world
Too afraid to step outside
Paranoid and petrified of what you've heard

[Bridge]
But they could say the same 'bout me
I sleep 'bout three hours each night
Means only twenty-one a week now, now
And I could say the same 'bout you
Born blameless, grew up famous too
Just a baby born blue now, now
[Chorus]
I don't blame you
But I can't change you
Don't hate you
But we can't save you
[Bridge]
(Same 'bout me)
(I sleep 'bout three hours each night)
(Means only twenty-one a week now)
(Same 'bout me)

(Means only twenty-one a week now)
(Same 'bout me)
(I sleep 'bout three hours each night)
(Means only twenty-one a week now)

Ooh-ooh
It's over now
It's over now
It's over now

Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak

I'm looking at thе boys
I've never filled the void
Out of spite
You seem so paralyzed
It's so romanticized
If this is how I die
That's alright
[Chorus]
I've been overseas
I don't need to breathe when you look at me, all I see is green (I've been overseas)
And I think that we're in between everything I've seen
In my dream, have it once a week, can't land on my feet (I've been overseas)
Can't sleep, have you underneath all of my beliefs
Keep it brief
I'll see you in the suite
We can be discreet

[Verse 2]
But I've been overseas
And I've been havin' dreams
L'amour de ma vie
Love so bittersweet, mm
Open up the door for me, for me
'Cause I'm still on my knees
I'm stayin' off my feet
[Part III]
[Drop]
(Will you come with me?)
(Just want you to tell the truth)
(Come on now, ha)
(And I know it seems like something even bitter)
(Listen up, hm)
(I've watched you keep on doing better)
(It's someone I don't know)
(Pay close attention to it, right now)

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Da-da-da-da
[Verse 1]
Love when it comes without a warning
'Cause waiting for it gets so boring
A lot can change in twenty seconds
A lot can happen in the dark
Love when it makes you lose your bearings
Some information's not for sharing
Use different names at hotel check-ins
It's hard to stop it once it starts (It starts)
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm
Makes me wanna take a picture
Make a movie with you that we'd have to hide
[Chorus]
You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me whеn you're alone
Won't take a lot to gеt you goin' (Oh)
I'm sorry if it's torture though
I know, I know

[Verse 2]
It might be more of an obsession
You really make a strong impression (A strong impression)
Nobody saw me in the lobby (Saw me in the lobby)
Nobody saw me in your arms, mm
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm ('Bout the way you look tonight)
Makes me wanna make 'em jealous
I'm the only one who does it how you like (Only one who does it how you—)
[Chorus]
You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me when you're alone (You're alone, you're alone)
Won't take a lot to get you goin' (Get me goin', get me goin')
I'm sorry if it's torture though (Torture though)
I know, I know
You better lock your door (Oh)
And look at me a little more
We both know I'm worth waitin' for (Waitin' for)
That heavy breathin' on the floor (On the floor)

I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
[Chorus]
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love"
[Verse 2]
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade

Sometimes, you look the same
Just like you did before the accident

[Chorus]
I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I
[Verse 2]
In a standstill on the 5
Thought it was unusually early traffic
Usually, I don't panic
I just wanted to be on time
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder
I didn't even think of pullin' over
I pieced it all together late that night

And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared

What if it happened to you on a different day?
On a bridge where there wasn't a rail in the way?
Or a neighborhood street where the little kids play?
Or the Angeles Crest in the snow or the rain?
What if you weren't alone? There were kids in the car
What if you were remote? No one knows where you are
If you changed anything, would you not have survived?
You're alive, you're alive, you're alive

And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In your hospital bed, I remember you said

Breathe the air again, it's a beautiful day
I wish this moment would stay with the Earth
Some primal paradise
But there you go again, saying everything ends
Saying you can't depend on anything, or anyone
[Chorus]
If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide
Or run for your life
Or stand here and spend it with me
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy?
[Verse 2]
And we would live again
In the simplest of ways
Living day after day
Like some primal animals
We would love again
Under glorious suns
With the freedom that comes with the truth, mmm

[Chorus]
If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide?
Or run for your life?
Or stand here and spend it with me?
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy?
[Bridge]
So it finally came to pass
I saw the end of the world
Saw the madness unfold like
Some primal burial
And I looked back upon
Armageddon
And the moment of truth
Between you and me

If we had five more minutes of air to breathe
And we cried all through it
But you spent them with me
On our last few drags of air we agreed
I was and you were happy

I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (Anyone before)
Too bad they're usually deranged
[Verse 2]
Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged
[Chorus]
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

[Verse 3]
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given, mmm (Not on his permission)
(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mmm

Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now, mmm

For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine

Do you know me?
Really know me?
You have opinions about my opinions
About my music
About my clothes
About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people praise it
Some people use it to shame others
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you watching
Always
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
If I lived by them, I'd never be able to move
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
The body I was born with
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
And judge me for it
Why?
We make assumptions about people based on their size
We decide who they are
We decide what they're worth
If I wear more, if I wear less
Who decides what that makes me? What that means?
Is my value based only on your perception?
Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?

Instead of stoppin', they still were flashin' (I don't really)

All these other inanimate bitches, it's none of my business
But don't you get sick of posin' for pictures

So don’t waste the time I don't have
And don’t try to make me feel bad

But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you ’cause I was a kid

Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)

[Chorus]
There’s only minutes before I drop you off
All we seem to do is talk about sex
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
[Verse 2]
I loved your friend when I saw his film
He's got a funny face, but I like that cause he still looks cool
She's got a boyfriend anyway

[Verse 3]
Now we're on the bed in my room
And I'm about to fill his shoes
But you say no
You say no
Does he take care of you?
Or could I easily fill his shoes?
But you say no
You say no

[Chorus]
Now we’re just outside of town
And you’re making your way down
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She’s got a boyfriend anyway
[Chorus]
And I'm not trying to stop you, love
If we're gonna do anything we might as well just fuck
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She’s got a boyfriend anyway
[Outro]
You've got your tongue pierced anyway
You in your high tops any day
You in your skinny jeans anyway
You and your fit friends anyway
I'd take them all out any day
They've all got back combs anyway
You all got boyfriends anyway

Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go
[Pre-Chorus]
She was cryin' on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
[Chorus]
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I'm burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?
(Mm) Hmm
[Verse 2]
Well, good things don't last
And life moves so fast
I'd never ask who was better
'Causе she couldn't be
More diffеrent from me
Happy and free in leather

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
Wanna put it all behind me, but baby
[Chorus]
I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Feels like a fever, like I'm burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?
[Bridge]
You say no one knows you so well (Oh)
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt
Valentine's Day, cryin' in the hotel
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself
[Chorus]
And I wonder
Do you see her in the back of your mind in my eyes?
[Outro]
You say no one knows you so well
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt
Valentine's Day, cryin' in the hotel
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself
