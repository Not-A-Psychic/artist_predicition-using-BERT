Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday, then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Verse 2]
I gotta say, I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean, I'm sayin', what kind of tease is two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them, more of them
More you on me, on us, just tell me you want me, yeah, Monday
And I'll be at your door, ready to take her place
Ready to give you what you've been missin' on weekdays

10:30, no later than, drop them drawers
I know what you want

Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit
[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me
[Chorus: SZA, Jacob Collier & Both]
All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

[Verse 2: SZA, Jacob Collier]
Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit
[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent" (It's urgent)
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind (My mind)
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me
[Chorus: SZA, Jacob Collier & Both]
All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

[Verse 3: SZA]
Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now
[Outro: Jacob Collier]
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind

I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should

I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone
[Verse 2]
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so mature, I'm so mature

I did it all on no drugs (Drugs)
I did all of this sober
I did it all for us, oh
I did it all for love (Love)
I did all of this on no drugs (Drugs)
I did all of this sober
Don't you know I did it all for us? (I'm gon' kill your ass tonight)

Oh, I just killed my ex (My ex, oops), not the best idea (Idea)
Killed his girlfriend next, how'd I get here? (He left me no choice)
I just killed my ex (My ex), I still love him though (I do)
Rather be in Hell than alone

Go
[Verse 1]
Why is it so hard to accept the party is over?
You came with your new friends
And her mom jeans and her new Vans
And she's perfect and I hate it
Oh, so glad you made it, I'm so glad you could come by
Somebody get the tacos, somebody spark the blunt
Let's start the Narcos off at episode one
Bring the gin, got the juice, bring the sin, got that too
Won't you shut up? Know you're my favorite
Am I
[Chorus]
Warm enough for you outside, baby? Yeah
(Tell me if it's warm enough here for you)
Is it warm enough for you inside me, me, me, me?
Warm enough for you outside, baby, yeah
(Tell me if it's warm enough here for you)
Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me
[Verse 2]
I get so lonely, I forget what I'm worth
We get so lonely, we pretend that this works
I'm so ashamed of myself, think I need therapy-y-y-y
I'm sorry I'm not more attractive
I'm sorry I'm not more ladylike
I'm sorry I don't shave my legs at night
I'm sorry I'm not your baby mama
I'm sorry you got karma comin' to you
Collect your soul, get it right

[Chorus]
Warm enough for you outside, baby? Yeah
(Tell me if it's warm enough here for you)
Is it warm enough for you inside me, me, me, me?
Warm enough for you outside, baby, yeah

Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me
[Bridge]
Sorry, I just need to see you, I'm
Sorry I'm so clingy, I don't mean to be a lot
Do you really wanna love me down like you say you do?
Give it to me like you say you do?
'Cause it's hard enough you got to treat me like this
Lonely enough to let you treat me like this
Do you really love me
Or just wanna love me down, down, down, down?
[Chorus]
Warm enough for you outside, baby, yeah
(Tell me if it's warm enough here for you) Outside, baby, yeah
Warm enough for you inside me, me, me, me (Me, me, me, me, me)
Warm enough for you outside, baby, yeah
(Tell me if it's warm enough here for you) Outside, baby, yeah
Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me (Warm enough outside, inside)

Warm enough outside, inside
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Oh, is it warm enough
Outside, inside?

Run fast from my day job
Runnin' fast from the way it was
Jump quick to a paycheck
Runnin' back to the strip club
I'm never goin' back, never goin' back
No, you can't make me
Never goin' back, never goin' back (Nah)
They'll never take me
I've paid enough of petty dues
I've heard enough of shitty news
I've had a thing for dirty shoes since I was ten
Love dirty men alike

Better day than yesterday (Keep cuttin' up)

Got a shift at 10 AM (Yeah)
Gotta dip at 10 PM (Nah)
Gotta get that cash
Won't get past a lunch break
I ain't had a smoke break
In about two days, don't break (Ugh)
Been about three years since I dated you
Why you still talkin' 'bout me like we together?
I moved on for the better, you moved on to whoever
I was down for whatever and then some
You gon' make me late to work again

Havin' nobody, only you, buddy
Can you hold me when nobody's around us?

Runnin' away from where I'm from
Never can stay with no one
Lovin' you almost feels like something
When no one's around me
You lost and found me
I was surrounded
With open, open, open

Open arms (Ooh)
Open arms
You keep me open, I'm so devoted
You keep me open (Ooh)
Open arms
I'm so devoted to you, to you, to you

Spent your life bein' hopeless
Chokin' on insecurity
I know ownership's bad
But please put a leash on me anyway
Who needs self-esteem anyway?
I hate myself to make you stay
Push me away, I'll be right here
With open, open, open

I'm forever ridin', we forever guided
Pull up on an opp, hit his curb up, slide it (Brr)
Notice when you mad, ain't no words, just silence
Drew my favorite color, now you seein' every shade of me
You say that I'm trippin', I hit back like, "Where you takin' me?"
Locked in for life, on God, no replacin' me
Consequences, repercussions, karma keep on changin' me
For you, I try
Face card, valid ID
C'est la vie, go to Paris
It ain't five-star, it ain't me
Over-solid, keep it concrete
I'ma bet it on you, a whole fee
Just don't switch sides
I could fire piece your wrist, AP
Through the ups and downs and all the heat
Take a turn and tell you what it be
Backshots make you feel relief
Anything, just don't you ever leave

[Outro: SZA, Travis Scott, & Both]
I guess I gotta go (Ooh)
I guess it's time to go
I gotta let you go
(I'm so devoted)
You keep me open
Gotta let you go, gotta let you go
I gotta let you go, I must
But you're the only one that's holdin' me down (Ooh)
You're the only one holdin' me down (Only one)
'Cause you're the only one that's holdin' me down

Real niggas do not deserve pussy
Meaning it's more you see right through walls
Ain't talkin' about pussy
Meaning you deserve the whole box of chocolates
Come with me
Forrest Gump had a lot goin' for him
Never without pussy
You know, Jenny almost gave it all up for him
Never even pushed for the pussy
Where's Forrest now when you need him?
Talk to me, talk to me, hey, ayy, hey
[Chorus: SZA]
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride
Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, just why (Why)
Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride (Ride, ride, ride)
You are now watching MADtv
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas'll lose they mind for it, wine for it, dine for it (Pussy)
Spend time for it, see no colored line for it (Pussy)
Double back, handicap, and go blind for it (Pussy)
Pussy got endless prisoners, pussy always revengin' her
Pussy is calculatin' and good pussy is rather dangerous
Pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
Pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that
I mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks
And the screw face when the bae look
Won't get you no pussy
I mean, the fake chains and the code names
For insecure, gon' reassure you not to get pussy (You not to get)
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy
See, that's what pussy niggas do
I know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin' at you
How many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?
How many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?
But if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you
Solána, middle fingers up, speak your truth

[Verse 3: SZA]
You could never trivialize pussy
But a bum nigga like you would try it (Pussy)
I know what you really 'bout
High-key, your **** is weak buddy (Pussy)
It's only replaced by a rubber substitute
We ain't feelin' you, oh
I think I caught a vibe, kinda feel a nigga
You could touch the booty if you like, I ain't trippin' on ya
(Such a nice girl, SZA)
I'm really tryna crack off on the headboard
And bust it wide open for the right one
Is you that for me?
'Cause if you that for me
[Bridge]
Like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy like doves in the wind
[Chorus]
I will make you beg for it (Attention, all you niggas)
I wanna see you crawl (All you bitches)
I'll give you all of me and I won't stop, not a little bit
(Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride)
Make you beg for it, I wanted to do it all
(Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, just why)
Unfortunately, you couldn't get your shit together
(Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride)

We take things, and my influence so far, and then it's out of my hands. And, you know, while as I said it can be scary, it can also be a little bit comforting.

And no, I'm not keeping your shit
Heard you got some new homies, got some new hobbies
Even a new ho too
Maybe she can come help you
Maybe she can come lick you
After we're done, what's done is done
I don't want nothing else to do with it
Let me tell you a secret
I've been secretly banging your homeboy
Why you in Vegas all up on Valentine's Day?
Why am I so easy to forget like that?
It can't be that easy for you to get like that
Oh, no, she didn't, ooh, yes, I did
Oh, no, she didn't, I'll do it again

Leave me lonely for prettier women
You know I need too much attention for shit like that
You know you wrong for shit like that
I could be your supermodel if you believe
If you see it in me, see it in me, see it in me

Why I can't stay alone just by myself?
Wish I was comfortable just with myself
But I need you, but I need you, but I need you

[Verse 2]
"Ooh, just get a load of them, they got chemistry"
All they could say, we like brother and sister
Look so good together
Bet they fuckin' for real, and they was right
That's why I stayed with ya, the, the dick was too good
It made me feel good for temporary love
You was a temporary lover
[Chorus]
Leave me lonely for prettier women
You know I need too much attention for shit like that
You know you wrong for shit like that
I could be your supermodel if you believe
If you see it in me, see it in me, see it in me
I don't see myself
Why I can't stay alone just by myself?
Wish I was comfortable just with myself
But I need you, but I need you, but I need you

Only want your love if it's solid
But if it's fuck me, then fuck you (Huh)
And that's the way I like it

Ain't crackin' a smile for none of these bitches

Had a lil' side thing, but right now, he's just the homie
Tryna feel good inside, he never wanna hold me
Pipe me up, you get me hype, you my favorite coach
Come press the line
Fucking stress off, that's my only vice
I take it off when he tell me if I'm feelin' fine
I run it up, risk it all like I'm rolling dice
Takin' it all, it's my second life
That's me (That's me)
Passed out in a Maybach seat ('Bach seat)
Crashed out on a black-sand beach (Uh)
Already know my body
Already know that's me
Bitch shit, then you might get minked

Blow the '87 guts, why they waitin' on us? Tell 'em I was on PCH
You fuckin' with niggas that's thinkin' they cuter than you, oh
Say you on your cycle, but he on his period too, oh
The tables been turnin' so much, I was thinkin' it's foosball
The tenderness of 'em, mistakin' 'em for some wagyu, oh
Walk, talk like Kenny, like boss
Like Solána, I promise, more buzz, it's a wasp
It's a crater or a spaceship, shut the fuck up, get lost
No favors, I'll wager whatever you worth, I ball
Somethin' about a conservative, regular girl that still can beat a bitch ass
Thorough as fuck, don't need your bitch ass
Psychic as fuck, can read your bitch ass
Zodiac sign, it must be a Gemini moon 'cause, shit, we about to go half
Mistakenly, nobody been in they bag, but how many bodies done been in her bed?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar, SZA, Both]
Some of y'all gon' get washed (Washed)

Hurry now, baby, stick it in

What's left of you
How am I supposed to tell you

You proposеd, I went on the road
You was feelin' empty so you lеft me
Now I'm stuck dealin' with a deadbeat

If I was you, I wouldn't take me back
I pretend when I'm with a man it's you

Repeating pain (Why?)

Therе's got to be more, been here before

Find something worth saving

All I ask is don't make me pull up and get to dumping
You know I can't give no fucks, you know I'm with all the ruckus, can you?

Fuckin' up a check, I don't want no receipt
Might get possessed, let my spirit speak freely

Mama told me never shit where you lay at
I don't want righteousness
I hurt too much, I lost too much, I lust too much
I hit my clutch and vroom
Third day, pop out the tomb
I love when you pull your gun at the red light
I like all that violence, give me dysfunction
I like when you come, never stay the whole night
Better when you high, never tell me I'm wrong

'Cause my past can't escape me
My pussy precedes me
My, my, how the times change
You still talking 'bout babies
And I'm still taking a Plan B

Stuck in Nintendo, you're the controller

Come Desdemona, Othello and tragedies
Shakespearean sorrows, where do I begin?
Where do we begin?
[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I got L's on my record
Weed on the vinyl
Keys open doors when them keys is albino
Now knock on my door when my stars is a Lionel
I've been fishing for a minute, for a minnow
Only I know that a pawn is a trade
And a rookie for a castle like tuition for a final
Playing hooky for a tassel, spend a minute on the minor
Wins on my window
Ash on my skin, when the record low temps for the wind blow
Only write rhythm to the tardiest of tempos
Only ride shotgun when the car is a limo
Y'ar see
I crowd surf in a cypher
Scuba in my shower, take an Uber to my neighbors
Used to pay the piper, till Peter picked it better
Now the first thing you should tell is where the hell is all the paper
But memories keep coming back
All the nights that we used to laugh
Wanna know how I used to was, how I used to was

[Outro: SZA & Chance the Rapper]
Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
(Here in your backyard, building a fantasy)
Just wonder how I used to was, how I used to was

Can you make me happy? Can you keep me happy?

Can you touch on me and not call me after?
Can you hate on me and mask it with laughter?
Can you lead me to the ark? What's the password?

I need humanity
Y'all lack humanity, drowning in vanity
Craving humanity
Y'all lack humanity, I need humanity

Scared of givin' mutual respect, all that you hate
You reflect all that godlike, you forget how to love somebody

Robot got future, I don't
Robot get sleep, but I don't power down
I'm wide open, I'm awake, I'm on autopilot
I'm out of my mind and I'm wide open

I just think about myself and look where that got me
Standin' on my own in an airport bar or hotel lobby
Waiting to feel clean
That's so fucking boring

Can you touch on me and not call me after?
Can you hate on me and mask it with laughter?

You say I'm too wild, you gon' hate me now

Thinkin' 'bout us fucking, why you'd have to fuck her?
I don't wanna see you, why'd you have to treat me
Like I was an ordinary girl?

Shaped like a figure eight, who trusts pretty girls anyway?
And I can't recall the last time I took advice from anyone

And I can't recall the last time I took love from anyone
I called daddy, who's got one anyway? Not me

You said that we're equal but I know you're beyond guessing
That I'm beyond desperate (Yeah, that)
6AM on a Friday morning, my darkest hours
Them heartless hours, my apartment is lost in a coffin
I'm dead to the world like I popped me a couple downers
Down & Out on my luck
Salt water all on my tux and I call, she don't pick up
Then I fall when summer is ending
I mean, there's no pretending
I'm stuck in my ways and you're offended, that's life
That's you, this me, that vice
You're wrong, I'm right, that's right
I belong somewhere on ice
I'm cold, and my new blood type?
Even colder, cold shoulder
Born Sinner, you know? Cole showed us!
I have nothing to lose
My dark side been well in-tuned
A Gemini gon' show them faces
And this here just one of my moods, Babylon

Who cries anyway? Spread like disease all over me
We did ungodly ghastly things, last night I mean
Who's God anyway? You're mine any day
It's burning, take me
I wanna feel your power, this final hour, tell me
Are you losing yourself? Will you lose it for me?
Are you losing yourself?

Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired of always making amends?
I know you hate me now (Here)
I bet you hate me now (Here)
Bring on the thorny crown (Here)
Crucify me

Now that I've ruined everything, keep it all for me
Now that I've ruined everything, space is all I need

Chasin' fatter ass and fake connections
Chasin' façades in all directions
Chances are I've got no direction

Beggin' my angels for protection
Thankin' my stars, livin' reckless, oh

Pretty little bird, pretty little bird
You've hit the window a few times (The window a few times)

Split mind, don't need to decide when
Straightforward, eyes on the climbin'

Birthin' bitches in my third trimester
Shift eyes, they tell me you lyin'
Don't care, just lay here beside me
Hang time chasin' the rewind
Hang time

You better learn how to facе it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl

Can't think, it's too hard to process
Get around you and I regress
I decide what demons I digest

Tryna find deeper meanin' in nonsense
Tryna grow without hatin' the process
Tired of anticipating the worst yet
Still anticipating the worst (Worst)

Yes, I've been used to being used like this
Ain't no difference, I'm immortalized in my thoughts
Praise to the most high for protection
Over my most prized possessions
Talkin' 'bout my sanity's at a 6.7
Handin' out poinsettias
To my dead homie mothers, prayin' they feel better
Might get chipped mindin' my business
Might get chipped sharin' my vision
Might as well
Can you tell if it's even worth conversation?
Hit a prayer, do it even work?
All that's for real is forever
Moments stolеn taste better

Thought you had anothеr one, went and caught him with ol' girl

I'm out of touch, I need a level that's a mile away
Need you once, girl, once, girl
We're goin' out the way
I feel like it's over
Something callin' to get closer

[Verse 2: SZA]
Count my blessings twice as much
Let death stress me too much
Can't hide from pressure, too worried I'm livin' a lie
Can't trust nobody you ain't been broke with
Niggas love to break my focus, bitch, I'm Obi Wan
You caught in the maze, I
Thought it'd be easy to get myself what I needed, but it takes some time
And I'm out of patience, I burned it with you
Can't lose myself to your ego, I wanna say
Love me better when you try less
I don't take much, just need your honesty, oh
Love will work better when you confess
Feelings don't need discussion
Spend my life discoverin' new shit
[Chorus: Don Toliver]
I been ridin', ridin' through this cold world
Thought you had another one, went and caught him with ol' girl
I feel like it's over
Something's callin' you, get closer

Need you once, girl, once, girl

All my exes still love me
Call me up, he wanna freak
All my opps lookin' distressed
How you copy then compete?
Oh, you just mad that your nigga want me
Oh, you just mad that we went ten weeks
Oh, you just mad that your ass ain't free
Scared to say shit so you fake kiki
Scared to cut a nigga so I left, ski-ski

I ain't scared of shit so I let mine go
Pop my shit 'cause I can, I know

And I can't lose my focus, I know if hope is the goal
Then I can't succumb like these cum-guzzlers at all (Nope)
And I know that if love is my purpose
I can't waste energy looking for enemies, I just dub it all
I'm anti-beef, half y'all bitches be too cheap
Half a milli when I bling, fuck I look like on my knees?
You really just mad 'cause I make it look easy
I'm really this bad, you should see it 3D
Brought you this bag, you should spend it on me
All of my time precious, so be

I been up 'til midnight, drivin' to nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
Bumpin' a slow song, can't get my head clear
I been up 'til sunrise, headed to nowhere
Hopin' that someone's missin' me somewhere

[Chorus]
Drivin', just drivin' (Just drivin')
Just tryin', just tryna get my head right
It'll all be better when, when I
When I, just gotta get my head right

Roll the clip and run it back, I'm really like that

You test it, I might go
You push it, I might pop

Your favorite athlete screamin', "Text me back"
I make no exception
The lesser part of me loves all the cap
He screamin', "Get back togеther"
I'm screamin', "Back of the bus, trick"
Hawaii for wеather
Booty softer than leather
These hoes is featherweight
I wipe my phone and gave some dome, I beat the case
Them "ho" accusations weak
Them "bitch" accusations true
You hatin' from nosebleeds, I wish you well

Tried to wash all of my shit away
Tried to wash all my emotions
Need a few brews, need a palm tree
I be drinkin' in private, don't call me to party, though
Fuck on your nigga for cardio
Too good, he really fell in love right away
I put my feelings on layaway, I'm

Done being used, done playing stupid
Done faking cool

Done being screwed, done feeling clueless

Far, far like I don't recognize me

Far, stay far, so far

Lately, I feel less cool as before
(Nobody under my garter belt)
(Nobody out here to tell me I'm special)
Made you check your bullshit at the door
(Got an appetite, hungry to feed my ego)
(Nobody 'round me to be my hero)
Always on my mind, trust is hard to find
Everything reminds me of us
I just want my sanity back
Better than being your enemy
(Better than letting go, scared of that, oh)

Done being used, done playing stupid
Done being cool
(I don't want none of that shit, I ain't goin')
Done getting screwed, done playing clueless
That's how you do

Far, far like I don't recognize me
Far, far 'cause I let you define me
I'm far, far 'cause I can't trust nobody

Stress me out and turn me out, it's all bad now
I remember when I wasn't so burnt out

I'm the original G-O-D
Makin’ young ladies scream is my specialty
When I go da-da-da-da-da-da-da, girls get hype
I'm the funky rap music, stereotyped
When I kill that ol' mad rugged flow
Not sayin’ Ason, duck of the disco

Baby, baby, I can't stop

I don't mind who's watchin', get to pushin' your wig back
I don’t mind burnin’ bridges, love my enemies, center peace
Call that bitch my kid, she ain't no kin to me
Gotta watch how you whisper when you around me, though
Give a fuck what you prefer, I’m too profound to go
Back and forth with no average dork
It goes spells and sorcery, hug your rosariеs
I don't mind competition, it is what it is
You don't mind second fiddle, that's why you a bitch
You don’t think for yoursеlf and that's none of my business
You take it I dish it, I'm genie, three wishes
Better watch how you think out loud if it's 'bout me, though
Got a couple that's outside, they kill about me, though
I don't need nobody help, angels surround me, though
Back and forth it go, it's hard, I know

Digging out of graves is never easy

Close your eyes, let go, and count to ten
I'll keep track of every moment wasted

Chill Baby
39 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolChill Baby Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been in and out of town, tryna get out of survival
Mode, I'm tired of building walls
I want everybody free, know I gotta start with me
Hard to fight the urge to build that wall
Tired of watching people die, literal or figurative
I just want someone to stay around
I don't trust nobody, no, you fuck anybody now
Doing anything to get around
[Pre-Chorus]
Woo, I'm so sick of all this shit, damn, let's dip
Yeah, yeah
I think we found a bit of peace right here
Woo, I'm so sick of all this shit, damn, let's dip
Yeah, yeah
I think we found a bit of peace right here

Chill, baby, don't go, baby
Chill, baby, don't go, baby
Chill, baby, don't go, baby
Chill, baby, don't go
[Verse 2]
I've been in and out of town, lies manifest
Relyin' on a tragedy to end up here
What don't kill you makе you strong, that's a law to keep you going
Defyin' gravity to face my fears
A rеminder that's on God, a reminder that I can't stop shit
It's all in motion, I'm so impatient
In the end, we all we got, in the end, I hope love finds us
That's all I'm sayin'

Woo, I'm so sick of all this shit, damn, let's dip
Yeah, yeah
I think we found a bit of peace right here

Loving alone is what you make it

Stay for the storm if you can take it

But pray for a raincoat to bare the brunt of mistakes
I know you worry a lot if I’ll be here for you

Dying of daydreams in your bedroom

Been waiting so long, said you’d be here soon

Forgot all your mistakes and dirty drawers?
You know I care for you
When hell over earth came, I stood for you
Will you stand for me?

You feel me?

I wanna be purified within
No more hiding
I wanna be in love for real though
Don't care what it costs me
I'll trade anything to feel now

Failing for real, lost in the real
Hurting for real, chasing for real
Anything real

Earning for real, hurting for real
Passion for real, risky for real

I romanticize the scariest things
Wonder if I die, will I be forgiven for everything?
Probably not, probably shit on my name
Probably spit on my grave, why should I let 'em in?
Why would I choose to stay? Do it all for my friends
Do it all ’cause my mama ain't got nobody but me
I owe her everything, Daddy for everything
Only one's ever saw me for me
Saw me for me, saw me for me
[Refrain]
Love me for me, can you love me for me?
Only one’s ever saw me for me, love me for me

I remember wanting a diamond ring
Wanted you to define me, I let you pay for everything
Why not? Treated me like a slave
Promise you I'll behave if you let me try again
For you, I'd change my name
For you, I'd kill my fame
For you, I'd be so different, won't recognize my face
Can't wait to go to my grave for you
All I'd care for you, you never saw me for me
Saw me for me, loved me for me

Loved me for me, saw me for me
You never loved me for me, saw me for me

You gave me a ring with a fucking castle on it
And a diamond on top, that's all I really wanted

With samurai swords
At least we died together, that's what I thought
I woke up hugging leather, am I out of pocket?

Talk love, girl, I need me plenty more (Plenty more)
For many more, many more times

Nightbird
27 ContributorsNightbird Lyrics“Nightbird” is the third song released by SZA on her Soundcloud on August 22nd, following the release of “Joni” and “I Hate You."[Chorus]
Stay the night
Even if it's not for real
Stay the night
Only got you for a short time
Going through a hard time
Hoping you could carry my demons part time (My demons, oh)
Asking too much past the basics
Too much, just stay
[Verse 1]
Could it be we're just not right for each other?
You say, "I bare the noose"
We fuck her over, think how?, wondering to myself
How I ruin it this time? Why try?
But you know you're fucking with a diamond
Lost the shine, then do it justice, baby, ew
Heard you tryna build with a new bitch
Can't front, I don't need this now
I can't take no chances when you're manic
You gon' make me go and get my bros on you
Woes on you
Running across my mind it's kinetic
Connect to you with еase
Ain't no fucking with our timing, yeah, yeah
Closеd on Sunday, gotta get that good God in
Sinning by Monday, you hit it from the side
I can't stand the way you treat me
Can't stand to watch you leave

[Chorus]
Stay the night
Even if it's not for real
Stay the night
Only got you for a short time
Going through a hard time
Hoping you could carry my demons part time
Asking too much past the basics
Too much, just stay
[Verse 2]
I miss you the most when my side do me dirty
I might be a hoe but you match so it's okay
I put you on hold, for the money, I can't play
You so touch and go, I can't tell if it's all fake
These bitches don't know you ain't shit, but I won't say
Secret safe with me, fuck in the back of the jeep
Fuck when you had no sheets
How you mad at me? I'm your battery
You should bow to me
Baby girl, you know what they say
"You ain't getting used, then you're fucking useless"
Must be a dummy by the way you do me
Coulda got some money, shoulda utilized me
But this too late, and I'm so straight
And them old ways, and we cold case
I tap into the mmm, weed, yeah
You talking all that shit but I ain't see no real yet
Is you calm?

[Chorus]
Stay the night
Even if it's not for real
Stay the night
Only got you for a short time
Going through a hard time
Hoping you could carry my demons part time
Asking too much past the basics
Too much, just stay

High, higher, baby
[Verse 1]
How you livin'? Are you doin' fine?
Are you gettin' money? Do you need a ride?
I've been livin' off Adderall for, like, three months straight and I
I've been trippin', I've been gettin' mine
I've been dippin', I've been livin' life
I appreciate the high life
But I just wish things were better between the ones that I love
No, I don't want to try hard
Just don't wanna be, don't wanna be alone
[Chorus]
Stuck with just weed and no friends
Weed and my pen
End of the day, it's just trees in the wind
Day in the wind, day in the wind
D-d-day in the wind
Day in the wind, t-t-trees in the wind
Trees in the wind, trees in the wind, trees in the wind
D-d-day in the wind
Blow it down and blow it down, pass it down
(D-d-day in the wind, to the left)

[Verse 2]
I got a casing, got knocked out
I'm waitin' to see if they'll take me to jail, no
Gee, I kinda hope they lock me up and throw away the key
'Cause I don't wanna go to work this week anyway
Woke up like, "Why me?"
I heard that waist training get you a good boyfriend
I am not searching for one though
Girl, you too pretty, you could do better
Called you a cab in the mornin'
Girl, you know you should've called me
Would've roll it up, could've smoke it up with you
High, high-high, high, high-high
High, high-high, high, high-high, high
[Chorus]
Stuck with just weed and no friends (Weed and no)
Weed and my pen
End of the day, it's just trees in the wind
Day in the wind, day in the wind

Killed a small boy once, never told no one

Instead of sitting in the dark, going through hell

Wish you had been here

Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky

Guess I've been used to bein’ used like this
Ain't no difference
I'm immortalized in my thoughts
Praise to the most high for protection
Over my most prized possessions
Talkin' 'bout my sanity's at a six-point seven
Handin' out poinsettias
To my dead homie mothers, prayin' they feel better
Might get chipped mindin' my business
Might get chipped sharin' my Benjamins
Might as well
Can you tell if it's even worth conversation?
Hear the prayer, do it even work?
All that's for real is forever
Moments stolen taste better

Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn, burn

Stuck in your tandem

Watching yo nigga keep doubling back

Never 'gain, get a new one first
Green Jeep to the mm-mm
And I rode that till the sun came
Got Hawaii on my mind
Can't go back 'til the summertime
’Til I think about you, you
Fire back, fire back, fire back, get him
High right now and I still feel like I’m dying
Don't know what I’m to do about the way I feel
You got me tripping out the palm of your hand

[Chorus]
Brace yourself, it could be worse
You could be dead right now
Instead of later, I know you hurting, baby
Brace yourself, it could be worse
You could be dead right now
Instead of later, it's now or never (Baby, ooh)

Life of a suburban kid
Existentialism
I ain’t never care much for esoteric shit

I keep an angel on my shoulder, devil in my head
He said...

Violate the bounds of platitude

Who do I do it for? Who do I do it for?
I hope I do it for you
Hope I do it for you

Still don't have an answer
Figure when I die it will make sense
Maybe God will answer
Until then

Ice Moon Revisited
30 ContributorsIce Moon Revisited LyricsSZA wants to find her way to a hiding place, a place she thinks she may wanna go, to leave everything behind.
Go to church if you’re scared.[Produced by Felix Snow and Pat Lukens]
[Verse 1]
I would die and say, "I been wasting all of my life on this moment"
Like we go all day
Fly away, you go and I, for it
I'd rather be with you tonight
I'm tired of the truth, just lie to me
I wanna run away
I wanna go home

Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go there
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go, go, go there
Go to church if you're scared
[Verse 2]
I lay formless
Hands tied in my sheets, star signs say I'm rare
Chosen by who?
I-I-I-I-I-I wonder who's watchin'
Whose wing I'm under
Sweep me up and I'll go
No questions take me, I'll go

[Chorus]
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go there
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go, go, go there
Go to church if you're scared
[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Put the herb in the air, take control of your life
Get them leeches out your ear, nothin' but leaders over here
We ain't drinkin' Sprite
I can quench your thirst, I can dim the lights
You can come first, shit, you can come twice
Long as you coming baby, you ain't gotta hide
You ain't gotta lie
We can lay together, No more lonely Septembers
Cold and stormy weather, I know you remember
And whether or not we decide to tie a knot or not
I rather have than have not
Don't be afraid
[Chorus]
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go there
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go, go, go, go there
Go to church if you're scared

I know I wanted to be your pretty lover
I only wanted to be your undercover
And now you can't commit, baby, now you're throwing fits
'Cause your phone ain't ringing like it used to do
How do you feel?
Now you wanna take it back, now you wanna ghost somebody
Why you gotta treat me like that, you're already with somebody
[Refrain: SZA]
Suddenly I don't understand, when I call, when I come by
I don't need no man
[Chorus: SZA]
Suddenly you wish we were back together
Telling me you wanna get back together
Just the way you had me was so much better
Say you didn't think it would be forever
(Ooh)
[Verse 2: SZA]
I don't know I just, I have better things to do
Better men to call, better time to spend an'
How d'your man try to get you up, get you up, get you-
How do you look good, when you put it like that?
How d'you look good, when you put it like-
How d'your man try to get you up, get you up, get you-
How do you look good, when you put it like that?
How d'you look good, when you put it like-

Six times, I don't know, I just

[Refrain: SZA]
Suddenly I don't understand, when I call, when I come by
I don't need no man to fly, maybe we

Maybe we get back, maybe we don't
Maybe we call, maybe it's gone
Maybe you'll love me, maybe you won't
(Ooh)
We'll see, come again, we can talk about it
Suddenly you wanna, call on, or love on, or hold on to my-
Well call them other girls
You can try, you can see, if it works, gladly
I'm a little bored, I got a little more things to entertain my time
And summer getting real close, weather getting real hot
Shorts getting real short, skin getting real tight

[Bridge: SZA]
(Back together)
I don't want a place for you
(Back together)
I don't even have a place to even begin getting back to you
(So much better)
I think you've run its course
(Be forever)
I think you've reached the end of the line, darling
I think you've reached the end
Keep it classy, don't cry
I know it hurts, I know you want it
I know you long for the love
So "back together" sounds like an old tune
Like a holiday since passed
Just a call I won't answer no more
[Outro: SZA]
(Back together)
(Back together)
I'm onto new things, new sounds, new feels, new times
(So much better)
And you old news (Be forever)
You old news, I can't stand it (Ooh)
I don't know I just

Pray for yourself one time
Pray for yourself one time
[Verse 1]
Young Medusa
Never sure, I just do
I jumped off the bridge
You say I fell, I say I flew
Missing parachute
Feeling like Topanga, Patty Mayonnaise
Kind of average with queen qualities
Got molecules I possess
Ever more, nothing less
[Pre-Chorus]
I think I'm starting to feel something
Here in the dark
I think I'm starting to feel something
[Chorus]
Keep burning up
Keep burning up
Pray for yourself one time
Pray for yourself one time

[Verse 2]
Broken glass unswept in my mind
Brooms too heavy to bear struggles that I find, confusion
Gravity is relative
Sandcastles are still real life
They hold dreams like the real ones do
I take care, building castles too
[Pre-Chorus]
I think I'm starting to feel something
Here in the dark
I think I'm starting to feel something
[Chorus]
Keep burning up
Keep burning up
Keep burning up (Pray for yourself one time, pray for yourself one time)
Pray for yourself one time
Pray for yourself one time
Keep burning up (Pray for yourself one time, pray for yourself one time)
Pray for yourself one time
Pray for yourself one time

You’re probably thinking, "My God, this poor girl has really flipped," but I ha-I haven’t flipped Doc-Doctor Hill

There are plots against people, aren’t there?
Yes, I suppose there are
There’s one against me and my baby
Come to my office tomorrow after five–

Umm, my husband may call you and ask–
I’m not going to speak to anyone, I’m going to take a nap–
Alright

The Anonymous Ones

Ever look at all the people, seem to know exactly how to be? (How to be, how to be now, how to be)
You think they don't need piles of prescriptions to function naturally? (Functioning natural)
Take a look and you might just catch it, stay a minute more (Minute more, minute more now, minute more)
There's a little moment after the sunny smile that eyes fall to the floor (To the floor, to the floor now, to the floor)
[Pre-Chorus]
And then truth starts peeking through (Peeking through)
They don't lie like me and you
They can fake a smile too
[Chorus]
Thе anonymous ones never lеt you see the hate they carry (They carry, they carry, they carry)
All those anonymous ones never name the quiet pain they bury (They bury, they bury, they bury)
Keep on keeping secrets that they think they have to hide
What if everybody's secret is they have that secret side?
And to know, to know we're not alone is all we're hoping for
I don't wanna be anonymous
I ain't gotta be anonymous
I don't wanna be anonymous anymore (Anymore)
[Verse 2]
Spot the girl who stays in motion, spins so fast so she won't fall (World's spinning so fast, spinning so fast)
She's built a wall of her achievements to keep out the question, without it is she worth anything at all?
[Pre-Chorus]
And truth starts peeking through
They don't lie like me and you
They can fake a smile too

[Chorus]
The anonymous ones never let you see the hate they carry (They carry, they carry, they carry)
All those anonymous ones never name the quiet pain they bury (They bury, they bury, they bury)
I don't wanna be anonymous
I ain't gotta be anonymous
I don't wanna be anonymous anymore
[Bridge]
The parts we can't tell, we carry them well, but that doesn't mean they're not heavy
The parts we can't tell, we carry them well, but that doesn't mean they're not heavy (I don't wanna be anonymous anymore)
The parts we can't tell, we carry them well, but that doesn't mean they're not heavy, heavy
[Chorus]
Anonymous ones never let you see the hate they carry (They carry, they carry, they carry)
All the anonymous ones never name the quiet pain they bury
Keep on keeping secrets that they think they have to hide
What if everybody's secret is they have that secret side?
And to know, to know we're not alone is all we're hoping for
I don't wanna be anonymous
I ain't gotta be anonymous
I don't wanna be anonymous anymore
