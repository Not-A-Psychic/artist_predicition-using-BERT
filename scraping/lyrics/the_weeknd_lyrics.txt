Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
[Verse 1]
Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know
[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Verse 2]
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse
[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
[Bridge]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh, baby)
Only you to trust, only you

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine

Reminder

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Oh-oh-oh)
[Chorus]
You know me (Know me, uh, na-na-na-na-na)
You know me (Know me, know me, oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, know me, na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me)

[Verse 2]
Said I'm just tryna swim in somethin' wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you
[Chorus]
'Cause you know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, ah, na-na-na-na-na)
You know me (Know me, know me, oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, know me, na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am (Try to forget who I am)
I'll be right there to remind you again (Hey)
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me, know me)

Why don't you shake somethin', shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work somethin', work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'
Baby girl, won't you shake somethin', shake somethin' (Shake some)

We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place

After Hours

Thought I almost died in my dream again (Baby, almost died)
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep (Oh, oh)
Without you, I can't sleep (Fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe
[Verse 2]
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
[Verse 3]
Never comin' down, uh
I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again
[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah

[Bridge]
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home
[Chorus]
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, no

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I ran out of tears when I was eighteen
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me, then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga, then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never makin' money, ah
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pullin' up in Aventadors
Just know we been grindin' on them sidewalks
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life

Flippin' blue lightnin', tightenin', strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Aw, Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (Head)
Head, head, more head (Head)
Oh God, bless the dead (Yup)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?

I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one

We are not the same, I am too reckless

And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'

Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick, tell her friends about it

Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera
Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera
Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour-là
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour-là
Je ne pleurerai pas
Je ne pleurerai pas
[Verse 1]
I guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
Girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased
Girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
'Cause I'm not as hard as I make it seem to be
[Chorus]
And it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I say that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)

[Verse 2]
Happiness exists when you don't know a thing
So I hope you don't think this song is about you
And only I can know how close you came
But baby I'm a pro at letting go
I love it when they come and go
[Chorus]
But it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I say that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)

The Morning
180 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolРусскийFrançaisDeutschPolskiPortuguêsThe Morning Lyrics[Intro]
I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
"Listen, listen"
[Verse 1]
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work
[Verse 2]
Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (Zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work
[Verse 3]
Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw, ain't no nigga with her rollin'
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive (The money is the motive)
All that money
The money she be folding (The money she be folding)
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work

[Verse]
Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
She bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah, I'm always on that okey-dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

All alone, she was livin'
In a world without an end or beginnin'
Baby girl was livin' life for the feelin'

She'll never walk away

Now she dances to the song on the minute

Go down that road again (That road again)

I'm always ready to take a life again (That life again)

When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone

Who gon' pray for me? Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me? 'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you, if I'm gon' kill for you
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today, I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption, the souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture's comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be
Sacrificed for the greater good, then that's what it gotta be

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Who gon' pray for me? Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me? 'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you, if I'm gon' kill for you

Sit your sexy ass on that couch

I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO

But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish

But when she put it in her mouth
She can't seem to reach my...
Ballin' ain't an issue for me
I'll make a hundred stacks right back next week
Do it all again, I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing
And I'll admit, baby, I'm a little camera-shy
But exceptions can be made, baby, ‘cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
'Cause if you're back here only takin' pictures
You gon' have to take your ass home
[Bridge]
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk

Oh, girl, don’t hold back, let it out

You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free
You gotta pay with your body
Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right
I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you to my West Coast girl
Until they book a show in NYC
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep
Woah, I'm tryna finish all this potion
Baby, take your time, I'm tryna sip it 'til the mornin'
And if you're still up, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'
Said, I'm two days strong
And never sleep until it's mornin', until the mornin'

'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth

[Verse 3]
I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long, I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones and
Probably not if my niggas round them up and
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn, I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida 
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep

[Outro]
This ain't nothing to relate to
And this ain't nothing to relate to
And this ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
And this ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried

Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous (Oh!)

Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dyin' (Feeling like I'm dyin')
Shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher (Get me higher)
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private (Oh!)
My flight too private, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet
[Chorus]
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (Know I might like it)
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (Know I might like it)

Don't be mad, let her get hers (Get her, get hers)
Don't be mad, let her get hers (Don't be mad; Get her, get hers)
She made her own luck, she don't give a fuck
She's tryna have fun, take a break from the love
Man, your girl so bad, let me get her (Get her, get her)
Your girl so bad, let me get her (Get her, get her)
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
On call till the fall, he can like it or not, nigga, back the fuck up
If you ain’t with me, motherfucker, you against me ('Gainst me)
If you ain’t complimentin' nigga, you offendin' ('Fending)
I've been out here last year wasting hella time (Hella time)
XO is the only time invested
Them Fall shows every year like a birthday (Birthday)
And I'ma do it every year in my birthplace (Birthplace)
And I ain’t been this gone since Thursday (Thursday)
I never said that I’d be sober in the first place
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I just passed that "Nigga fell off" stage
Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now that word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be soundin' like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all love now
Shout my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow
[Outro]
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, (I make) all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, (I make) all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, (I make) all of them swallow
All of, all of, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, (I make) all of them swallow

[Verse 1]
Light a blunt up with the flame
Put that cocaine on a plate
Molly with the purple rain
'Cause I lost my faith
So I cut away the pain, uh
Got it swimming in my veins
Now my mind is outta place, yeah, uh
'Cause I lost my faith

Well, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone

I've been sober for a year, now it's time for me
To go back to my old ways, don't you cry for me
Thought I'd be a better man, but I lied to me and to you

I take half a Xan' and I still stay awake
All my demons wanna pull me to my grave
I choose Vegas if they offer Heaven's gate
I tried to love, but you know I'd never stay
I'd never stay
But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside me
I want you to follow right behind me
I want you to hold me while I'm smilin'
While I'm dyin'
And if you know me
When I go missing, you know where to find me
Driving down the boulevard is blindin'
Always blinded by the desert lights and
I'm alive when

When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone

Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love

Twenty Eight
106 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolEnglishItalianoTwenty Eight Lyrics[Verse 1]
This house is not a home to you
But you decide to go ahead and lay down, lay down
There are no words to describe the depth of your indifference
’Cause I see you’re here to stay
Should’ve known to pick my fate (Oh no)
[Chorus]
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
[Verse 2]
Hey there, lonely girl
Did you have to tell your friends
About  the way I got you screaming my name?
Did you have to tell the world?
Now your girls all wanna fuck
Girl you could’ve been the one
Gotta change my number twice a month
When you could have simply kept it on the down low
[Chorus]
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)

[Verse 3]
Baby if I knew you’d be living in my sheets
I wouldn’t have shown you any love
I would have left you in the club
You said you don’t belong
You keep saying there’s no one
And there’s no where to go
But who keeps calling on your phone?
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
[Chorus]
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)

Girl, if your man call your phone again

Snowchild

I used to pray when I was sixteen
If I didn't make it, then I'd probably make my wrist bleed
Not to mislead, turned my nightmares into big dreams
Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets
You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
Cover girls jumpin' out the page like they pop-ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin', couldn't even breathe and
For that money, I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving
[Chorus]
Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh
[Verse 2]
She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex, give her Philip K. dick
She never need a man, she what a man need
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple M's like I was Shady
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis à la mode, nigga
And for that money, I been fiending
Cali was the mission, but now a nigga leaving

[Chorus]
Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh
[Bridge]
Twenty-mil' mansion, never lived in it
Zero-edge pool, never dipped in it
Superstar, neighbor in my business
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin' and
Goin' on tour is my vacation
Every month, another accusation
Only thing I'm phobic of is failing
I was never blessed with any patience
[Chorus]
So a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

You pillow talk to me about the men who try to get in between us
They buy you bags and jewelry, yeah
They think your kindness is so weak
No, you don't give it up so easy, baby
But you just wanted my attention
You just wanted my affection
You got me tattooed on your mind
You just want me all the time
We'll figure out our shit and find a way (Oh, yeah)
When you say that you need space, I give you space (You space)
Girl, when you're ready, you know where I stay
When it comes to all these hoes, I'll never chase
But this world is such a, such an evil place
Man, these hoes will always find a way
'Cause when I'm on the liquor, I go crazy
And for that pussy, you know I'm a slave, yeah

Well, this place is never what it seems
Take me out LA
Take me out of LA
This place will be the end of me
Take me out LA

I'm in the Spyder Porsche cruisin' down the street
Black on black venom covered seats
Keanu Reeves, way a nigga speed
Diamond cross hangin' off of me
I'm fighting for my soul, Constantine
And it's slowly burning, it was never cheap
If you seen what I seen, you wouldn't sleep
I can't sleep
'Cause I got everything I wanted
Got the money, got the cars, got the ceiling with the stars
Got everything I wanted
But I'd be nothing without you
Gave you everything you wanted
Gave you power, gave you life, gave you space so you can shine
Gave you everything you wanted
But none of that matters to you, oh-oh

Nobody walked in

I can't recognize
The same work done on they face

But her throat too fire
She got Chrome Hearts hangin' from her neck
And them shits going wild
When she ride, she hold tight
She gon' ride 'til sweat fall down her spine
She's all mine for the night
She's all mine until he calls her line

Oh, yeah, got you drinking out them white cups, sodas
All this shit so foreign to you, thick smoke, choking
Baby, get familiar with the order
Just crack it, then pour it, then sip slow, then tip low
My eyes red but my brim low, that XO
She climbing, straight to the top, forgetting why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate slow, put that rum down, you don't wanna die tonight
I promise, when you’re finished, we’ll head to where I’m living
The party won’t finish, it’s a fucking celebration, oh yeah
For my niggas out tonight
And they high off Shakespeare lines
There's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work, you don't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work, you don't gotta check the sky
We'll be going all night, 'til light
[Chorus]
I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys
[Verse 2]
And you've been going hard, baby
Now you rolling with some big boys, baby
Got a lot you wanna show off, baby
Close that door before you take your fucking clothes off, baby
Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak, and I'm experiencing fall
And all I wanna do is leave 'cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, tryna concentrate to breathe
'Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, heavy gum chewing
Go on if you thirsty, baby, if you thirsty
Grab a cup of that XO, baby, I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl, I've been fiending
For another round, don't you blame it on me
When you're grinding up your teeth and it's fucking hard to sleep

[Chorus]
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys

And we can make you right
And if you get too high
[Verse 3]
Baby, come over here and
Ride it out, ride it out
Work that back 'til I tire out
Roll that weed, bring that fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Bed so wet when I eat you out
Girl's friends scream that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep 'em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking reefer now
Bet a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out
Baby, baby

I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you

Woah, with a nigga like me

She said "Please, mercy me, mercy me
Let me fall outta love, before you fuck her, before you fuck her"
She begged me, she gave me all her pills
Now my back hurts
Oh, she lost control
[Chorus]
Now she pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
Baby got her pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
She said it won't be long before she falls out of love
It won't be long before she falls out of love

You have deceived her
You're just a bird

I tried to kiss you
But you never let me miss you

Look what you did, nobody forced your hand
And don't you fall for a nigga like me, I begged, I begged

Adaptation
125 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolفارسیSvenskaРусскийPolskiAdaptation Lyrics[Intro]
When the sun comes up, you're searching for a love
So your heart won't lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us
[Sample]
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
As I bid yesterday goodbye
[Verse 1]
I lay my head on a thousand beds
It's been a test to see how far a man
Can go without himself
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
I could've stayed
[Chorus]
But I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might've been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay, I adapted anyway

[Verse 2]
Adapted to these models
Who's adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
I'll stay up ‘til tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in Love and War
She's pure
[Bridge]
So pure, like the love that's so uncut and raw
And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered
[Chorus]
Because I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might've been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay, I adapted anyway

[Bridge 2]
She might just be the one
She might just be the one (Oh, baby)
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
[Sample]
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye

Professional

[Verse]
It's ideal, oh
You need someone to tell you how to feel
And you think your happiness is real
There's so much more the world has to reveal
But you choose to be concealed
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town?
I don't think you even know it
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town?
You made enough to quit a couple years ago
But it consumes you
It's everywhere you go
And just the thought alone got you trippin'
Got you losing your mind
And I don't blame you
It's everything you know
But I own this time, this ain't new
Now I decide when we're through
[Part II]
[Chorus]
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
We're professional

[Verse 1]
What does it mean, oh
When your heart's already numb?
You're professional
Won't treat it like it's personal
No, 'cause it's just love
It always makes its way back around
It's dispensable
To fall is unacceptable
'Cause everything you've been through made you stronger
And every day, you learn about yourself
And nothing really played out how it's s'posed to
Depending on somebody else's wealth
But now you know the value of a dollar
And girl, I make enough of it to spend
I love the way you put yourself together
I love the way you make that body bend
For me again, oh, yeah
[Chorus]
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...

[Verse 2]
All of those nights you were up barely holding your own
Girl, you've got it made
Had you blaming yourself for when life did you wrong
Now, you've got it made
Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song
Girl, you've got it made
'Cause your freedom was here in this cage all along
Oooh, how'd you drain all the soul from your eyes?
How'd you teach, teach yourself how to smile
In a world where your dreams can't be real, no?
Every touch that you sell is a lie
[Chorus]
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...

Ordinary Life

Heaven in her mouth, got a hell of a tongue
I can feel her teeth when I drive on a bump
Fingers lettin' go of the wheel when I cum
Whe-wheel when I cum, whe-wheel when I cum
David Carradine, I'ma die when I cum (Die when I cum)
She just givin' head, she don't know what I done
Like I'm James Dean, I'ma die when I'm young (Die when I'm)
Die when I'm young (Die when I'm), die when I'm young
[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven knows that I've been told
Paid for the life that I chose
If I could, I'd trade it all
Trade it for a halo
Yeah, she said that she'll pray for me
I said it's too late for me
'Cause I think it's safe to say

This ain't ordinary life

Valhalla's where all the righteous are led
Mulholland's where all the damned will be kept
Devil on my lap and a cross on my neck
Cro-cross on my neck, cro-cross on my neck
Over forty-five, I'ma drift on a bend
Do a buck twenty, I'ma fly off the edge
Everybody said it would hurt in the end
Hurt in the end, but I feel nothin'

Belong To the World
91 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolEnglishSvenskaPolskiBelong To the World Lyrics[Music Video Intro]
The wind in the sky
Please gather the clouds
And close the way of the wind
I need to make the beautiful dancer
Like a muse, so I can keep looking at her
Too bad if you forget about me
I have to live with it
We swear by God we will be together forever
Now I'm worried God will take your soul
Because you broke your promise
Like the fire which guards light up to search things
Burns up in the night
And fades into the daylight
Just as my love and thoughts of you
Burn in the night and fade into the sun
[Verse 1]
I know you want your money, girl
'Cause you do this every day, okay
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
Well, it's something I relate to
Your gift of nonchalance
But nobody's ever made me fall in love
With this amount of touch, well

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a fool
I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)
I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless, too
But you taught me how to feel
When nobody ever would
And you taught me how to love
When nobody ever could
[Chorus]
Ooh, girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world
And ooh, girl, I wanna embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world
You belong to the world
[Verse 2]
And I know that I'm saying too much
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue, yeah
And I'll pull you closer holding on to
Every moment 'til my time is done, yeah
And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile
In so long, I've succumbed to what I've become, oh, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a fool (I'm not a fool)
I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)
I'm not a fool (Oh, no) I'm just lifeless, too (I'm just lifeless, too)
But you taught me how to feel (You taught me how to feel)
When nobody ever would (When nobody ever would)
And you taught me how to love (You taught me how to love)
When nobody ever could (Oh, babe, oh, babe)
[Chorus]
Ooh, girl, I know I should leave you (I know I should leave you)
And learn to mistreat you (And learn to mistreat you)
'Cause you belong to the world (Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
And ooh, girl, I wanna embrace you (Oh, babe, I wanna embrace you)
Domesticate you (Domesticate you)
But you belong to the world (Oh, baby)
[Bridge]
You belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the loneliness of filling every need
Oh, no, you belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the temporary moments of a dream
[Chorus]
Ooh, girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world, ooh, yeah
And ooh, girl, I want to embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world

Pretty

Somebody told me it was pointless for me to come back
Into your arms
Said you fucked another man
Finally, I knew this day would come
Woah, oh-oh
'Cause I see fear in your eyes
You've been living out your life
As long as you know that when I land, you're mine
It's been exactly 365 since I've seen your face
I've been livin' on the road
And you've been livin' all alone at home
Girl, I hope, he made you satisfied (Kimochi)
Well, baby, I won't cry
As long as you know that when I land, you're mine
[Chorus]
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
[Verse 2]
There are certain things that I've come to understand
Expectations can kill a simple man, simple woman, woah
I try to master the art of that far away love
But only so much can keep a woman warm
Now it's times like this that I say to myself
We've been livin' in a cold, cold world, cold world
But at least I have you to rely
Even if for a short time
As long as you know that when I land, you're mine

[Chorus]
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there

[Chorus]
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there

[Outro]
Quand une putain de colombe blanche chante sa chanson
C'est tout ce qu'on entend
Les jours se défilent comme de la ficelle dans le vent
Embobiné dans ma toile, je les dévoile à nouveau
10 ans mon ami, que rien d'autre ne compte
Elle n'était qu'une gamine à ce moment
Souffrant d'un cœur brisé, une douleur très profonde
C'est là où je l'ai aperçue, seule, prête à entamer ses 17 ans

If you commit to this ride

I’ve been killing these shows
But I'm always getting high
'Cause my confidence low
And I'm always in a rush
Ain't no time to fuck slow
And even if I try
It's not something I would know
But I'm sure I'll make you cum
Do it three times in a row
And I'm sure you would have left
Put that pussy in control
Got that pussy in control
I got it in control

The last few months, I've been workin' on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby
I look back now and I realize
[Pre-Chorus]
And I remember when I held you
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
[Chorus]
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)

If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Give me one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like I shoulda loved you all the time

Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Ooh
[Verse 1]
You been pickin' my voice to dance to
You say my money no good in here, even though I didn't ask you
And it's the most you've worked
Even though I probably don't deserve this girl
But you been dreamin' for this moment, so you have to
Baby, it's okay
I got show money, baby
I wanna show you how I blow money, baby
I wanna show you how I throw money, baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby, ooh-ah
'Cause I'm a star
Don't get it twisted, got some trappers in my car
What kind of caps? I got the brownest of them all
Somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all
Before we pop 'em all

[Pre-Chorus]
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached, but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good (It feels so good)
It feels so good (It feels so good)
It feels so good (It feels so good)
It feels so good, good, good, good

Mama, I understand why you're mad
And it hurts to accept what I am
And how I live
And what I do
But I've been good since Thursday
Yes, I've been good since Thursday
So you can watch my love vanish in a girl with no talent
But to make mula vanish call her friend for my friend
And her friend's name's Lexus
I let my niggas test it
Her morals worth a cent and best believe I already spent it
My blunt full of B.C, my cup full of Texas
Flown on that OVO jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you ain't gotta ask, "Who's next? Who's next?"

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't nothing (No), but it's all I need (It's all I need)
And the peak ain't reached (Ooh-ah), but the peak is all I feel (Ooh)

It feels so good, good, good, good

Tears In The Rain
95 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsفارسیSvenskaРусскийPolskiTears In The Rain Lyrics[Chorus]
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain, hmm)
[Verse 1]
When it's said and done
I already felt love
And I let it end up
End up dying by itself
And when it's said and done
You were better off
You deserve real love
And I deserve to be by myself
'Cause I've gone too far
And I started too young
To give up
And even if I changed
It would be too late
I exposed my ways
Now every girl I touch

[Chorus]
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame, ooh
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain)
So now that she's gone (Oh, no)
Embrace all that comes (Embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (Alone you've become)
They all feel the same
[Verse 2]
I should've let you leave
But I let you watch me slip away
I could've set you free
But I'm selfish
I watched you stay, oh, yeah

Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me

She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away

[Chorus]
They all feel the same (Ooh)
Adjust to the fame (Adjust to the fame, baby)
'Cause no one will love you like her (No one could love me)
It's pointless (No one's gonna love me)
Like tears in the rain (No one can love no more)
So now that she's gone (Oh, now that she's gone, baby)
Embrace all that comes (Oh, embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (I'm not gonna show the world, oh, how alone I've become, oh)
They all feel the same (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
Adjust to the fame (Ohh, adjust to the fame, I ain't tryin' to be alone, baby)

You'll never make me stay, so take your weight off of me
I know your every move, so won't you please let me be?
I've been here times before, but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time you won't seduce me
[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby, do what you please
I am the stuff that you want, I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes, she touchin' me so to start
She say, "There's no turnin' back," she trapped me in her heart

Every musician's fan after the curtains come down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree

She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say, I want to go too far

But I hate sleepin' alone, why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright"
Diana walked up to me, she said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that I ran to the phone sayin', "Baby I'm alright"
I said, "Unlock the door 'cause I forgot the key"
She said, "He's not coming back because he's sleeping with me"

Been faded on the floor
In this penthouse prison, I'm alone

Now you're better on your own, it ain't a fucking mystery
You've been showing me
Now I've been burning up my home, baby

I tell myself that I'll take you for the last time
I'll be over you eventually
Time after time, you seem to brush me off

You wash your neck when you leave, now I know your routine
I was in love with your mystery
Now I'll just take what I can get from you
I'm not embarrassed to be what you want me to be

And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done

Well, here comes the sun
And you're in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you'll stay through the night

Here We Go... Again
159 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolРусскийPortuguêsItalianoहिन्दीPolskiFrançais한국어Here We Go... Again Lyrics[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Strike a pose with my kinfolk
Front page of the billboards
Suit and tie and cigar smokes
Macallan shots 'til it burn throats
We still celebratin' Super Bowl
Catalog lookin' legendary
Ring froze like it's February
XO, that's a mercenary
A quarter bill on an off-year
Used to sing on lofts
But now we cruisin' on a yacht, we clear, yeah
Said you wanted your boyfriend jealous with a couple pics
And you didn't expect to fall for me once you got this dick
The city dark, city dangerous
Your girlfriend's tryna pair you with somebody more famous
But instead you ended up with someone so basic, faceless
Someone to take your pictures and frame it
And my new girl, she a movie star
My new girl, she a movie star
I loved her right, make her scream like Neve Campbell
But when I make her laugh, swear it cures my depressin' thoughts
'Cause baby girl, she a movie star
Baby girl, she a movie star
I told myself that I'd never fall
But here we go again

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ooh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Although this love is strong to me
Some things can change, go wrong with me
We don't know how it's gonna be
Forever is too long to me
We don't need the government involved because we like to touch
We don't need no damn religion tellin' us that we in love
But if we did crush down the road, spendin' lawyer fees up
Pen and pad gon' save my ass if these feelings freeze up
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ooh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again

[Outro: The Weeknd]
The number one station to free your soul (Free your soul)
