A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like
[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too

And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine
[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, "Darlin', you look perfect tonight"
[Verse 2]
Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

[Pre-Chorus]
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight
[Bridge]
No, no, no
Mm, no, no
[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person and she looks perfect
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight

Lovin' can hurt
Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still
[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
[Verse 2]
Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

[Pre-Chorus]
Mm, we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still
[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
[Bridge]
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
[Chorus]
Oh, you can fit me
Inside that necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat, where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearin' you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home"

When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when
[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm

'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh, I'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud

I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get-well-soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But, Mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
[Verse 2]
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
[Bridge]
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
[Chorus]
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, "Hallelujah, you're home"

Walkin' down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart

Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new

'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it, too
And until then, I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
[Post-Chorus]
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah
[Verse 2]
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursin' an empty bottle and tellin' myself
You're happier, aren't you? (Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
But ain't nobody need you like I do (Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
I know that there's others that deserve you (Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
But, my darlin', I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it, too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waitin' here for you

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"

My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen, but lately

Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
"The worst things in life come free to us"

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, banknotes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen, but lately

Closed eye and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen, but lately

Ten thousand rocks on the lake
[Chorus]
So don't call me "baby"
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
[Verse 2]
You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
What's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake every day
Don't know how much I can take
[Chorus]
So don't call me "baby"
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
[Intrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
Mm, I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sittin' back, lookin' at
Every mess that I made

[Chorus]
So don't call me "baby"
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
And let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
And before I dive right into you

Don’t
140 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeItalianoDon’t LyricsWritten about a relationship Sheeran went through, “Don’t” is believed to be about Ellie Goulding, though it’s never been officially confirmed.[Verse 1]
I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her, "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'
[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

[Verse 3]
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'
[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
[Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
[Verse 2: Andrea Bocelli]
Sei la mia donna
La forza delle onde del mare
Cogli i miei sogni e i miei segreti molto di più
Spero che un giorno, l'amore che ci ha accompagnato
Diventi casa, la mia famiglia, diventi noi
E siamo sempre bambini ma
Nulla è impossibile
Stavolta non ti lascerò
Mi baci piano ed io, torno ad esistere
E nel tuo sguardo crescerò

[Chorus 2: Andrea Bocelli]
Ballo con te, nell'oscurità
Stretti forte poi, a piedi nudi noi
Dentro la nostra musica
Ti ho guardato ridere e sussurrando ho detto:
"Tu stasera, vedi sei perfetta per me"
[Chorus 3: Ed Sheeran & Andrea Bocelli]
Ballo con te, nell'oscurità
Stretti forte poi, a piedi nudi noi
Dentro la nostra musica
Ho creduto sempre in noi
Perché sei un angelo e io ti ho aspettato
Quanto ti ho aspettato
Perché tu stasera, sei perfetta per me

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

[Verse 2]
Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far
[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say

Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned till the fun ran out, now

[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape

Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons
[Verse 1]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Callin' out, Father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside (High)
And if we should die tonight, then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Callin' out, Father, oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky
[Chorus]
Now I see fire inside the mountain
And I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
[Verse 2]
Oh, should my people fall, then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Callin' out, Father, oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire inside the mountain
And I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns, then my brothers will die
And as the sky is fallin' down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screamin' out
[Chorus]
Now I see fire inside the mountain
And I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (Oh, you know I saw a city burnin' out), fire
And I see fire (Feel the heat upon my skin, yeah), fire
And I see fire (Ooh), fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side

Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers

Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)

Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)

Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
"Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas"
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it "gifted"
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 50 Cent]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
(Hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can still remember (What?) tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?)
In my eyelids now (What?)
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no "if," "ands," or "buts" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem, 50 Cent]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questionin' what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, ah-yeah
[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Verse 2]
I used to think that nothin' could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're livin' your dream, man, this **** should be fun
Please, know that I'm not tryna preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Have conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve, tellin' me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, Dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's two hundred and forty thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasin' it now
Somehow
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, ah-yeah
[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Post-Chorus]
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
[Bridge]
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser
[Outro]
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

(One, two)
[Verse 1]
Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again
[Pre-Chorus]
We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears
[Chorus]
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
[Verse 2]
The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

[Pre-Chorus]
We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go

And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Na-na-na-na-na
[Verse 1]
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya
[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Verse 2]
Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gun sign
Says "Chune, bwoydem light up the room!"
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya
[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Bridge]
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me
[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
[Outro]
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new man

I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growin' old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, "No
You can't marry my daughter"
[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
[Verse 2]
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was workin' on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearin' borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growin' old
Five sons and three daughters

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
[Verse 3]
From her snow-white streak in her jet-black hair
Over sixty years I've been lovin' her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know, Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried 'bout the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya
[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but
[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
[Verse 2]
In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you

[Pre-Chorus]
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but
[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too

My three words have two meanings, but there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you, mh

And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I will mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now, now
[Verse 2]
I'm gonna paint you by numbers and colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it, and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it, but I've been here before
Now, I'll surrender up my heart, and swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love

Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take

But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I'll mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me

I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend
[Verse 1]
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinkin' of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh)
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

[Verse 2]
I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffin'
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothin'
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smokin' on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically, I'm demonstratin'
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi
[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

[Verse 3]
'Cause with the lyrics, I'll be aimin' it right
I won't stop till my name's in lights at stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now, I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young, I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'd gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over, but now, I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus, I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singin' them out
Wow, from day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now, I'm back to the sofa
Givin' a dose of what the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus, I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breakin' into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper's shoes usin' new laces
I'm sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the papers
Sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me, though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doin' shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growin' up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, readin' all the papers
They say I'm up and comin' like I'm fucking in an elevator

[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all

Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right
[Chorus]
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, "Remember that the answer's in the love that we create"
So much has changed since you've been away
[Verse 3]
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are
'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again
So much has changed since you've been away

As if no one knows anything but us

They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

So in love
So in love, love, love, love
So in love

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in a moment, I knew you, Beth

What Do I Know?

Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels"
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children, they will know what it means
And I'll pass on the things my family's given to me
Just love and understandin', positivity
[Chorus]
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talkin' 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashin' and their portfolios
While I'll be sittin' here with a song that I wrote
Sayin' love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

[Verse 2]
The revolution's comin', it's a minute away
I saw people marchin' in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people followin' their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understandin', positivity
[Chorus]
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talkin' 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashin' and their portfolios
While I'll be sittin' here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understandin', positivity
[Chorus]
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talkin' 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashin' and their portfolios
While I'll be sittin' here with a song that I wrote

Love can change the world in a moment

I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and, in return, I gave a song
It goes on and on
[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
[Verse 2]
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon? 'Cause from here, it looks the same
And only scars remain
[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

[Bridge]
But if I don't, then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger, but I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong 'cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
[Outro]
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself

She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one-way trip
Guess she went wanderin' off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
[Pre-Chorus]
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh, my baby, lately, I know

That every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear

Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells, ah
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh

Roses, roses laid upon your bedspread, oh my
Oh, this, oh, this, I know

The arms of a woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passin' over
Or the thought of growin' old
'Cause from now until I go

Every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holdin' me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah
Every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs, baby

Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how?
Going through the motions, going through us
[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walkin' me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright, I wanna feel your love, no
Easy, baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight, I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hopin' you'd stop

[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
But all of my words will always be low
Of all, all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walkin' me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright, I wanna feel your love, no
Easy, baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight, I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

Bibia be ye ye
[Verse 1]
I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me
From each scar upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee
And all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up upon his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand-new day
[Chorus]
Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
[Post-Chorus]
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye
[Verse 2]
I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand-new day

[Chorus]
Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye

Wo nooma (Be ye ye)

I've been sat with you for most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here, we wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know if you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close, take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady
[Pre-Chorus]
I need you, darling, come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we've got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and then just hope and pray
I told her my name and said, "It's nice to meet ya"
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now, she's kissin' my mouth
[Pre-Chorus]
I need you, darling, come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?

All the guys in here don't even wanna dance

All that I can hear is music from the back
(Can you feel it?)
I found you hidin' here, so won't you take my hand, darlin'
Before the beat kicks in again?
Can you feel it?
Ooh-ah-pa
Can you feel it?
Ah-no-no-no-oh, oh-no-woah

Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand (Hand)

All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep

Leave you wet like you scuba dived

South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone

I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, "Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown"
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London
[Verse 3: Stormzy & Ed Sheeran]
Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, "That's just the way things go"
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrappin' it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop)
And you can do Glasto (Headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feelin' alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Getting high)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (Like my home)
So take me back to London
So take me back to London

One

Tell me that you'd turn down the man
Who asks for your hand 'cause you're waitin' for me
And I know you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
[Pre-Chorus]
And would you take away my hopes and dreams
And just stay with me? Ooh
[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll never leave again now
'Cause you are the only one
[Verse 2]
Take my hand and my heart and soul
I will only have these eyes for you
And you know everything changes
But we'll be strangers if we see this through

[Pre-Chorus]
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh, Lord, now
[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend now
'Cause you are the only one
[Bridge]
Stumblin' half-drunk, gettin' myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singin' about love
And where it goes wrong
[Chorus]
And all my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

Mmm
[Verse 1]
I've been spinnin' now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sippin' on red wine
I've been sittin' here for ages
Rippin' out the pages
How'd I get so faded?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

[Post-Chorus]
Well, tell me when it kicks in

I've been lookin' for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord, forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?

Afire Love
52 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolAfire Love LyricsEd wrote this song about his grandfather’s death, and how he wished he’d known him better.
In “Supermarket Flowers”, Ed talks about the death of his grandmother.[Verse 1]
Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that Heaven is your restin' place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lyin' in the bed again
Either way, I'll cry with the rest of them
[Pre-Chorus]
And my father told me, "Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing
[Chorus]
Darlin', hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love

[Post-Chorus]
Love, love
[Verse 2]
And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now, we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standin' in the rain
And now, my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when
[Pre-Chorus]
My father told me, "Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing
[Chorus]
Darlin', hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love

[Post-Chorus]
(Ah-ooh) Love, love
(Ah-ooh) See the love, the love, the love, the love
(Ah-ooh) See the love, the love, the love, the love
(Ah-ooh) See the love, the love, the love, the love

And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing "Hallelujah"
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing "Hallelujah"
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing "Hallelujah"
(And all my brothers and my sisters, yeah)
And my father and all of my family (Ah)
Rise from their seats to sing "Hallelujah"

I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you'd been here before
And I don't get waves of missin' you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never gettin' dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with the head spin I got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not
[Pre-Chorus]
So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?
[Chorus]
That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

[Verse 2]
Everybody said we'd be together forever
But I know that I never wanna settle down, come around
Break-up the love like LEGO now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything's great, not everything's sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now, I'm in a position to be another stalker
Like everything I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss, it was perfect
We were nervous on the surface
And I'm always saying, every day, that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss
[Pre-Chorus]
So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?
[Chorus]
Oh, you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

[Bridge]
Because if I was gonna go somewhere, I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down (Woah)
And I'm thinkin' I'm unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
Keep lookin' around to make sure I'm not the only one to feel low
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will
[Chorus]
'Cause you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else
[Pre-Chorus]
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alonе

Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Delusion is here again
And I think you'll come home soon
A word brings me right back in
Then it's only me that's in this room
I guess I could just pretend
The colours are more than blue
But I lost more than my friend
I can't help but missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready
And when it unfolds, you get in a hole, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Everything changes, nothing's the same, except the truth is now you're gone
And life just goes on
[Chorus]
So I'm dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Take It Back

On MTV story tellers, Ed explains that this song is made up of couplets he typed into his phone… Read More [Verse 1]
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spittin' quicker lyrics, you know
You found me rippin' the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Which I would sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signs of a label, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew, but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now, it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I never tried to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoidin' cocaine like it was Get Carter
For four years, I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At sixteen years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleepin' at a subway station
To sleepin' with a movie star and addin' to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I take it back now
[Chorus]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no

[Verse 2]
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring 'em to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hittin' a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again, that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whisperin', "Everything that happens is from now on"
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still, they're claiming that I handled it wrong
But then, I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rappin' a habit and keep on fashionin' magic
I'm battlin' for respect and I don't know if I have it
This song's from the heart, cover the planet
I'll take it back now
[Chorus]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no
I'll take it back now

[Verse 3]
Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Puttin' on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considerin' a name change, thinkin' it was hopeless
Rhymin' over recordings, avoidin' tradition
'Cause every day, some lyrics and a melody can be written
Now, absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I say it again, livin' life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from a man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowin' up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screamin' out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achievin' life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes, I'm never havin' a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Havin' a pint with McDaid, discussin' records we made
And, every single second, knowin' that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, rememberin' our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now
[Chorus]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no, mmm

I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded too

You're just a small bump unborn
In four months, you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now, you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump, in four months, you're brought to life
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothin' but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
[Chorus]
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right
[Verse 2]
Ooh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months, you'll open your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothin' but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right

And you can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe

'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight

'Cause you were just a small bump unborn
For four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why

I met you when I was a teen, but then, you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringin' a bell
Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listenin' to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And "Re: Stacks" is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watchin' a DVD, smokin' illegal weed
Gettin' high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'd say, "You are beautiful without your makeup
And you don't even need to worry 'bout your weight
'cause we can all be loved the way that God made us"
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again
[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that's you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

[Verse 2]
And every weekend in the winter, you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away, we'd only speak on the phone
Watchin' Blue Planet, creatin' new habits
Actin' as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I'd disappear, you'd call me selfish
I understand, but I can't help it
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever, so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be takin' a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day, we'll have to say it again
[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that's you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

[Bridge]
Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?
People grow and fall apart
But you can't mend your broken heart
Take it back, go
Oh, won't you leave me now? (Ooh-ah)
[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina (Mmm)
(Love will come and love will go)
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh, won't you leave me now?
(Sing that song, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina (Oh)
(People grow and fall apart)
But then again, you should know, Nina
(But you can't mend your broken heart)
'Cause that's you and me both, Nina
(Take it back, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
(Love will come and love will go)
'Cause I ain't never comin' home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh, won't you leave me now?
(Sing that song, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina (I've been livin' on the road)
(People grow and fall apart)
But then again, you should know, Nina (But then again, you should know)
(But you can mend your broken heart)
'Cause that's you and me both, Nina (That's you and me both, Nina)
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

All of the Stars
45 ContributorsAll of the Stars Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's just another night and I'm starin' at the moon
I saw a shootin' star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
[Pre-Chorus]
You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wonder, do you see them too?
[Chorus]
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
[Verse 2]
I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playin' "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love

[Pre-Chorus]
So I took your hand back through lamp-lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beatin' to
[Chorus]
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
[Bridge]
And, oh
And, oh
And, oh
[Outro]
I can see the stars from America

Wake Me Up
72 ContributorsWake Me Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again and just replace it
See, I could do without a tan on my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath and fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
And maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray in the winter
I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder
[Chorus]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
[Verse 2]
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me?
Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way?
And I know you love Shrek 'cause we've watched it twelve times
But maybe you're hopin' for a fairytale too
And if your DVD breaks today, you shoulda got a VCR
Because I've never owned a Blu-ray, true say
And now I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I'd go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then, you'd laugh at me and be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then, you'd lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets

[Chorus]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
[Verse 3]
And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I'll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now, a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
[Outro]
'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Oh, maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up

Overpass Graffiti
59 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsDeutschفارسیItalianoOverpass Graffiti Lyrics[Verse 1]
This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip, hip, hooray, love
[Pre-Chorus]
Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both
[Chorus]
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
[Verse 2]
This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it
Leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us

[Pre-Chorus]
The car was stuck, the engine stalled
And both of us got caught out in the snow
Alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever known
The cards were stacked against us both
[Chorus]
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
[Post-Chorus]
Lost on me
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me
[Chorus]
Well, I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass, yeah
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lost on me
Ooh, graffiti on the overpass

It hit like a train, I ran out of words
I got nothin' to say, everything hurts
And I know love leads to pain
But memories serve our sweetest refrain, mmm
[Pre-Chorus]
The waves came tumblin' down
As you float away, I'm reachin' for ya
[Chorus]
To tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone
I suppose I'll sink like a stone
If you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on

Would I miss the flames, the heated reserve?
Oh, I'd remember thе way that you put me first
And what a heart-wrenchin' shamе
That you'll never know, just like tears in the rain, mmm

A constant grey in the clouds
When I hear your name, I think of love

So, tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone
I suppose I'll sink like a stone
If you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on

I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lipsticks to me
So now, I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishin' I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
[Pre-Chorus]
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold, I'll be freezin'
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evenin'
Take words out of my mouth just from breathin'
Replace with phrases like, "When ya leavin' me?"
Should I? Should I?
[Chorus]
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

[Verse 2]
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
There may be other people like us
We'll see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore
[Pre-Chorus]
On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer, but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?
[Chorus]
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

[Bridge]
All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
[Chorus]
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

The Man
52 ContributorsThe Man LyricsWritten in 2011, Ed raps about a recently ended relationship. Ed focuses on “the man” that she cheated on him with, and how, if they hadn’t broken up, they could’ve been together forever.[Verse 1]
Now, I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks, at least
Before you'd let him take you
I stayed true, I kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waitin' for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to find out
But **** it
I won't be changin' the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public, it's nothin'
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is, you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married, then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically, our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot? I think not

[Chorus]
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Anymore
[Verse 2]
Recently, I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to "Holocene"
You promised your body, but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time, we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to Uni'
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he told me that family
Is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with

[Chorus]
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Anymore
[Verse 3]
And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writin' a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is, if my career in music didn't exist
In six years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff, I fall into a spiral
And it's just hidin' my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'll be writin' my will before I'm twenty-seven, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge or did I make a mistake erasing ****?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually, I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be
Either way, I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change ****
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

[Chorus]
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore (Ah)
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby (Oh, no)
I don't wanna love you, no (Oh, no)
Anymore (Oh, no, now)

Of all the money that e'er I had
I spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas, it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now, I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
[Verse 2]
Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all
[Verse 3]
A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And, perhaps, be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then
[Chorus]
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

[Post-Chorus]
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us
[Verse 2]
What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I got nothin' left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best and the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays and

It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes?
What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two
To be lyin' awake, and be here talkin' to you
I got somethin' to say, I know what I gotta do
To be makin' a change, now the moment of truth
[Pre-Chorus]
Why am I feelin' so nervous when
Things are goin' so perfect? And
But I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you
[Chorus]
And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you
Darlin', honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight)
Will you marry me? Just say yes
One word, one love, one life
[Verse 2]
A gentle touch of the hand, fingers runnin' through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh, I was caught unaware
Arms holdin' me tight, tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives
Sun will reappear, burnin' auburn and red
My chest was the pillow, green grass lawn was the bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
And what a wonderful way to fall in deeper in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Why was I feelin' nervous when
Things were goin' so perfect? And
Well, now I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you

And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you
Darlin', honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight)
Will you marry me? Just say yes
One word, one love, one life

(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be

Gonna grab clothes, 6 in the mornin', go

Well, dad, just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this

Cold as stone in the kitchen light

I could be persuaded to hold on
And Mama was the same, none of us are saints
I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna run away and one of these days
I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces and hope that
Things change, but for now, I'll leave town
With a backpack on my shoulder

I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There’s nothing to say 'cause he knows

I feel it, can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I
I mean it, don't you turn off the light
So I don't wanna leave here ever, no
She was like, "Damn
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a lil' romance," hey
You and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
Oh, my, my, my
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Paulo Londra]
I was rolling off something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you (Ah, ah)
And you ain't got nothing on you (Leones Con Flow)
[Verse 2: Paulo Londra]
Mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol, ah
Quiero comentarle que no sé qué pasó, ah
Desde que salimo' por la tarde lo' do'
A besarno' lo' do', hasta hacer el amor
Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación
Lo que hacemo' lo' do' no se puede igualar
Parecemo' ficción cuando entramo' en acción
Esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeh (Yo'; ¡wuf!)
Pero lo que mata e' que esta noche no' vemo' ya en mi casa (Ey; wuh)
Y sé lo que te gusta y te atrapa
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Paulo Londra]
I was rolling off something with you (¡Wuh!)
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you
[Verse 3: Dave]
Look, take the lead, follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard to get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Homegirl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need, you and a sofa
I fly in a spaceship, I gotta land the Rover
Casa Cruz, Casa Blanca, Casanova
I'm a fashionista, she in Fashion Nova
And a mad persona when I had her over
The outfit, it cost bread, I got the matching loafers
Why? Cah that's somethin' to do
I got a million and two, but they're nothin' on you, nah
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I was rolling off something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
She was like, "Damn
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like, "Damn
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
Want to be your man
"Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like, "Damn"
And you ain't got nothing on you

Even My Dad Does Sometimes
36 ContributorsEven My Dad Does Sometimes LyricsWritten with Singer/Songwriter Amy Wadge about a friend of hers with cancer, this emotional song was given the title Hold On by fans long before the studio version was released.[Verse 1]
It's alright to cry, even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes, tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die 'cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight, hold on
[Chorus]
So live life like you're givin' up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
[Verse 2]
It's alright to shake, even my hand does sometimes
So, inside, we'll rage against the dyin' of the light
It's alright to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today, hold on
[Chorus]
So live life like you're givin' up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
And hold on
[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Mmm, live life like you're givin' up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
And hold on

First Times
40 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsItalianoDeutschفارسیFirst Times Lyrics[Verse 1]
I thought it'd feel different playin' Wembley
Eighty thousand singin' with me
It's what I've been chasin' 'cause this is the dream
When it was all over, I cleared out the room
Grabbed a couple beers, just me and you
Then we started talking the way that we do
[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember
[Chorus]
The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first drink, red wine, on a step in Brooklyn
I still feel the first fight and we both made it out alive
And I can't wait to make a million more first times
Mmm, mmm
[Verse 2]
The greatest thing that I have achieved
Was four little words, down on one knee
You said, "Darling, are you jokin'?", and I just said, "Please"
[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

[Chorus]
The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first look in your eyes when I said "I love you"
I can still feel the butterflies from when we stumbled home that night
I can't wait to make a million more first times
Mmm, mmm
[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember
[Chorus]
The first kiss, first night, first song that made you cry
First dance in moonlight in your parents' garden
I can't wait to see everything that's yet to be
Our first child and then a million more first times

Autumn Leaves
29 ContributorsAutumn Leaves LyricsEd Sheeran wrote this song about a dear friend that had passed away, and it is a bonus song on his debut album +.[Verse 1]
Another day, another life
Passes by, just like mine
It's not complicated (Oh)
Another mind, another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated
[Pre-Chorus]
And do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
[Chorus]
Float down like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday, you were here with me
[Verse 2]
Oh, another tear, another cry
Another place for us to die
It's not complicated
Another life that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated
[Pre-Chorus]
Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?

[Chorus]
Float down like autumn leaves
And hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday, you were here with me
[Bridge]
Ooh, how I miss you
My symphony played the song that carried you out
And, ooh how I miss you
And I, I miss you and I wish you'd stay
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
[Chorus]
Float down like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday, you were here with me
[Outro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Touch down like a seven-four-seven
We'll stay out and we'll live forever now

And you're the one when I want love
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
It's you and only you who can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
When I'm alone with you, you make it better again, yeah
Your arms are where I wanna remain

Your arms are where I wanna remain
Grab my waist when I start to say, now

Listen, little lady
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv makin' dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbin' if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothin' but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal 'cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's gettin' dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities stickin' their noses in
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly

[Verse 2: Mikill Pane]
Little lady, your mind, you've made up
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck, you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway
'Cause all the heroin is makin' you age
But you're a heroine for takin' the strain of bein' a prostitute and punching bag
The funds you have left go where you're from usin' MoneyGram
Mother had to get you out of the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know you're never comin' back
She put you in her brother's hands, only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer
Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
Now an angel will die, covered in white
With closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time now, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
[Verse 3: Mikill Pane]
Little lady, you're tremblin' with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
You're sitting facing the detective, oh, dear
The meddlin' nurse couldn't just leave it
She's only gone and made it much worse callin' police in
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
You're causing scandal goin' mad in the ward now
The cop is tryin' to calm you, tellin' you he won't let no one to harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, "Who you working for?"
He's talkin' to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore
You're havin' a conversation you could be murdered for
You're learnin' more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
He's kickin' knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid
'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says, "Where you been, bitch? I wanna know"
No prizes for guessin' who it is, resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door, he boots you in
There's somethin' new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror
Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error
He towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point, your life flashes before your eyes
Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
And we're all under the upper hand
And goin' mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
And fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
And angels to die

Tides
44 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoEspañolPortuguêsDeutschفارسیTides Lyrics[Verse 1]
I have grown up, I am a father now
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet
I still love getting out of my mind, I should cut it down
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now, I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it
[Pre-Chorus]
Freight cargo, dot stops, and aeroplanes
Late-night calls, signal is in and out again
Feelin' low on serotonin and better days
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with mе
[Chorus]
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And lifе, life is changin' tides
[Verse 2]
I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
I've no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way

[Pre-Chorus]
Low fly zone, lawsuits, and film stars
Headline wrote, "Princess and the face scar"
Broken bones, break-ins, and Babylon
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me
[Chorus]
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changin' tides
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changin' tides

Nando’s Skank
18 ContributorsNando’s Skank LyricsThis was a song freestyled by Ed Sheeran and the rapper Example on May 10th, 2010.[Ed Sheeran]
I said, oi, you, are you gonna bang doe?
No, I want some fucking Nando's
Wanna eat up with chicken and chips
Everyone knows I freestyle like this
When I freestyle on the beat about chicken
You know it's finger lickin'
And now I'm gonna pass it over to Example now
He's gonna freestyle and he's gonna show you how
[Example]
Chicken, chicken wings
They're my favourite things and I love to sing
I say chicken, chicken wings
If you give me them I will eat them tings
[Ed Sheeran]
Yo, and we eat chicken for free
Cause he's got a black card you see
He made a song about chicken from Nando's
And are you gonna bang yo?
Yes please I want some chicken right now
Please I want to put it in my stomach yes
It tastes so good I wanna eat the chicken
With the fucking breasts and the wings
And the thighs and the chips and the...

[Example]
And all them things that are nice
[One sec, keep going]
Nando's from me, fat chance I gotta black card
If you come to me and ask for chicken you'll get a fat scar
In your left cheek I eat Nando's every week
Sometime on a Tuesday, sometime on a Thursday (yo)
I get free drinks, refillable even when I'm thirsty
On a Thursday I eat chicken in the worst ways
[Ed Sheeran]
Yeah, I said we are on tour, saw him
I'm like get out the store, yo!
Cause you are a whore
Eat Nando's for free everyday on tour, yo!
And it's a par, I ate Nando's from your car
Can't freestyle cause you'll see me starve
I slap you in the face cause like I'm like Febreeze ya!
[Example]
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
I eat chicken off the floor
I eat chicken off the bone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken off the floor
Chicken off the sky
Chicken off the bone
I eat chicken off the bone

[Example & Ed Sheeran]
I love Nando's more than your mum does
More than your mum does
Nando's (I say oh)
I love Nando's
My tongue is on fire
I wanna say Elliot (yes Ed?)
Nando's I desire (I'll give it to you anytime you want babe)
I want some free Nando's from your black card
[Example]
You ain't getting in my wallet
Ain't getting in my wallet
I'm on it, I'm on it (I wanna take your black card)
You ain't getting my wallet
[Ed Sheeran]
Cause I need them pounds every time I go there to eat my food
And you're so fucking rude you don't fucking buy it for me
So I want Nandos for free
And you look like you put your fingers in electricity sockets
To get your hair up like this
[Example]
You're never touching my card, this is my card
You're never touching my card, this is my card
You come to me, play your guitar
Step to me hard, you ain't getting my card star

I want some Nando's

I want some Nando's (right now)
I want some Nando's right now

Eraser (Extended F64 Version)
36 ContributorsEraser (Extended F64 Version) LyricsThis is a special version for SBTV made to comemorate their 10 years and the 7 year anniversary of Ed’s ‘You Need Me I Don’t Need You’ performance for them, that set off his career.[Verse 1]
I was born inside a small town, I've lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questionin' what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a Uni' degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Showed me the locked doors, I'll find another use for key
And you'll see
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, higher
[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Verse 2]
I used to think that nothing could be better than tourin' the world with my songs
I chased the picture-perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're livin' your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please, know that I'm not tryna preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve, tellin' me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playin' for the people, Dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearin' the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasin' it now
Somehow
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Post-Chorus]
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
[Verse 3]
I woke up this mornin' lookin' in the mirror
Thinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner
The industry told me to look like them
But I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner
I wish that she could've been my first time
And I wish that I'd never took that first line
And I wish that every word in this verse rhymed
But forgive me if it doesn't
I wish that I could make peace with my older cousin
I wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't
I wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'
And the taste stays underneath my tongue and
Wish that I had known what to do as a youngen
Wish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party
But that hardly matters now, man, does it?
Wish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it
I wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget
But while we're on the subject
I wish my private life would have never gone public
But that's the sacrifice that we make
Spendin' my whole time high livin' life away

[Chorus]
I'm singin', this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama, but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin', this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama, but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
[Verse 4]
I wish my family and friends, they stay healthy
I wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy
I found myself late night wishin' on a star
Everyday, I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh
And I wish I'd never run through
Every woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to
I wish I was the role model you looked up to
If I told my fans the things I did, then they'd say, "Fuck you"
I wish I was home more
I wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays, but yo, we're on tour
And I wish I'd grown more, wish I told more people that I love 'em
But it's in the music that I'm known for
And I wish he never got cancer
And if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?
Oh, yes, I guess it does and we're still stressing 'cause
Every day, the **** gets the best of us
Losin' my balance on a razor blade
Spendin' my whole time high, wishin' life away
[Chorus]
I'm singin', this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
We got drama, but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin', this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama, but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
[Verse 5]
I'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat coat
Mum's sayin', "Don't smoke," though I don't listen, I got
Love for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast
People that I don't know share the same vision
I find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine
Tryna find a love with a compatible star sign
Sometimes, I can't write, sentences can't rhyme
Starin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryna find mine
Shit, quick, before I hit it again
Surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men
And who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen
Just let me hit the studio when we can rip it again
I'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick
My daddy told me, "Work hard and you can never be shit"
I've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad
Sat back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had
One wish

Boat
39 ContributorsTranslationsСрпскиDeutschहिन्दीPortuguês日本語ItalianoPolskiBoat Lyrics[Verse 1]
Came in for the embers
Stayed out for the breeze
I need to feel elements to remind me
There's beauty when it's bleak
[Pre-Chorus]
Stuck out long before lights down
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know
[Chorus]
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't brеak my boat

The stones crash on the boardwalk
Thе wind rush through the trees
I keep my eyes peeled
The memories always fall short
Of what we could've been

Left out long before last call
What do I need? Oh, I know

The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat
[Bridge]
But the waves won't break my boat
The waves won't break my boat
[Chorus]
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't
And the waves won't break my boat

You see tonight, it could go either way
Hearts balanced on a razor blade
We are designed to love and break
And to rinse and repeat it all again
[Pre-Chorus]
I get stuck when the world's too loud
And things don't look up when you're goin' down
I know your arms are reachin' out
From somewhere beyond the clouds

You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space

I see the light shining through the rain
A thousand colours in a brighter shadе
Needed to rise from the lowest place
There's silver lining that surrounds the grey

When I get lost, will you come back around?
Things don't look up when you're goin' down
I know your arms, they are reachin' out
From somewhere beyond the clouds

Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space

We were made to be nothin' more than this
Findin' magic in all the smallest things
The way we notice, that's what really matters
Let's make tonight go on and on and on

Findin' magic in all the smallest things

Let's make tonight go on and on and on

He rode through the streets of the city
Down from his hill on high
O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobble
He rode to a woman's sigh
For she was his secret treasure
She was his shame and his bliss
And a chain and a keep are nothing
Compared to a woman's kiss

For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are warm
For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are ...

Friends

We're not, no we're not friends, nor have we ever been
We just try to keep those secrets in our lives
And if they find out, will it all go wrong?
And heaven knows, no one wants it to
[Pre-Chorus]
So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know

Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you

We're not friends, we could be anything
If we tried to keep those secrets safe

But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you

Someone else might love you too
And then again, if we're not friends
There'd be nothing I could do, and that's why

Oh, I been on for a thousand nights

Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights
[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
This the type of shit we used to dream of (Yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch look like Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza (Splash, water)
Clear port, hasta la vista
Do it all again when we touchdown, everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose, I be like, "What now?"
I started makin' moves, they showin' me love now
Lit like a light bulb 'cause, bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda poppin'
I see it, I like it, I wake up, pull up, and go and cop it
The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold a rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now, I walk in a stadiums, tell 'em, "Play my shit"
And they gon' sing like this

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Last night, I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big, but why does it matter?
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember, damn, me and my man inside of this Splitter van
200 a night, end of 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was at the couch of a friend's
Wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
£2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent (Woo)
And I don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon
Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Oh, let me invite you to my world
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded (Gettin' faded)
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights
[Verse 3: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Mmm, I'm so faded, yeah
I don't even know how much I made this year
I'm so used to bein' on some player shit
Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
Hoodie on pull up, just like the Reaper, yeah
I do this on the regular, make you seem unfair
St. Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green Moncler
Me and Meek and Ed Sheeran just like the Beatles, yeah
From her head to her toe, she know she be flee, oh yeah
Everyday, I be seein' her and Ceiline, oh yeah
She wanna come closer, but I don't see us there
I'm not a regular person, I be low-key, oh yeah
From New York out to London
She was, she was with me all the time
And I've been on the road, so long she couldn't call my line
And now she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes

Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah

And her lips upon mine, so soft
Feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love

Oh, why, oh, why am I alone?
Did I, did I do somethin’ wrong?
Am I the reason or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl

How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms?
Well, that's the way to break my

American Town
17 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoPortuguêsDeutschAmerican Town Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're a long way from home
Haven't seen you in so long
But it all came back in one moment
And the year started cold
But I didn't notice at all
When we found there's a room we're both in
[Pre-Chorus]
We get Chinese food in small white boxes
Live the life we saw in Friends
Your room, it barely fits the mattress
Wake up, leave for work again
The wind, it seems to blow right through us
Down jackets are the trend
The rush of rushing deep into love
[Chorus]
English girl in an American town
No elevator to the fifth floor
I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down
I wish time would freeze
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out
Feet are three feet off the ground
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found
It's just you and me
My English girl in an American town
In an American town

[Verse 2]
The days come and go
But it ends when doors close
And the scent of your perfume's on me
You're useless with your phone
Electric when one-on-one
I thought I would be more nervous, darlin'
[Pre-Chorus]
We watch comedies and miss the endings
Conversations till the dawn
Any change in tide, we push against it
Challenge meanings in the songs
And head out without a reservation
Drinkin' out of paper bags
And wasting time is time not wasted
[Chorus]
With my English girl in an American town
No elevator to the fifth floor
I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down
I wish time would freeze
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out
Feet are three feet off the ground
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found
It's just you and me
My English girl in an American town

[Bridge]
And when our eyes are closed together, I can't explain
How the scent of your perfume takes me to a higher place
We can watch it unfold or we can change how it takes
And rebuild when it breaks down
[Pre-Chorus]
We drink Moscow Mules and steal the cups
From, mostly, the Bowery Bar
What a perfect day to fall in love on
What a way to make it start
It appears, when you think all is lost
Then, you don't remember when it started
Never have to pretend
[Chorus]
With my English girl in an American town
No elevator to the fifth floor
I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down
I wish time would freeze
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out
Feet are three feet off the ground
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found
It's just you and me
English girl in an American town
No elevator to the fifth floor
I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down
I wish time would freeze
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out
Feet are three feet off the ground

I'm drownin' in the oceans you made

When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one who'd make me lose it all
You are the start of something new, oh

And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall into my arms again
And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall now

You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing

And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall into his arms again
And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall now, woah

And take me back, take me home
Watch me fall down to Earth
Take me back for

Little Bird
36 ContributorsLittle Bird LyricsEd has explained the meaning behind this track a couple times when performing it live. A good example being his live show in Excelsior, Minnesota.[Verse 1]
"If we take this bird in with its broken leg
We could nurse it," she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when I wake up and your makeup is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, oh
[Chorus]
But if I kiss you, will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
[Verse 2]
If we take a walk out in the morning dew
We can lay down, so I'm next to you
Come inside for a little homemade tea
And if you fall asleep, then, at least, you're next to me
And if I wake up, you say, "It's late, love, get back to sleep"
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree with you beside me

[Chorus]
But if I kiss you, will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird, my little bird, my little bird
[Bridge]
And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You make me scream and then, I made you cry
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die
[Chorus]
But if I kiss you, will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoa
My little bird, my little bird, my little bird
You're my little bird

Salt Water
27 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschItalianoPolskiSalt Water Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's still so far to go and I can't feel my toes
When the rain soaks through the heels and slips to the sole
Yeah, the blades are two feet tall, I wade in green
I'm movin' forward, to where? God only knows
Feel the wind's harsh refrain like the clouds gripped my face
Saying, "It's alright to run from all this pain"
Oh, and when it's time to go with one last breath that's in my lungs
I'll scream, "It's all for love," I'll scream, "It's all for love"
[Chorus]
Come and kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep and leave everything
It was just a dream
[Verse 2]
I can see it up ahead where the sky meets the ground
And after that, there's only moving grey
I am filled up with regret
With things I did or never said, just leave that well alone
[Chorus]
And come kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep and leave everything
It was just a dream

[Post-Chorus]
(Ah-ah)
It was just a dream
It was just a dream
(Ah-ah)
It was just a dream
Was it just a dream?
[Bridge]
Now, I'm standing on the edge, gazing into hell
Or is it somethin' else? I just can't tell
When there's nothin' left, I close my eyes and take one step
And say, "Well, here it goes," I say, "Well, here it goes"
[Chorus]
Come and kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep and leave everything
It was just a dream

Hey, I waited for you all day
[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I been away on the road for a little while
Today, I'm headin' home to make my baby smile
She hates it when I am over a thousand miles
Away, and I'm not there to pick up when she dials, yeah
She's always lookin' back, and sayin' "There was a time
When you would be around every single night
Now, I'm not sayin' that I want another guy
But I need you here for the good times and the bad times
Yeah, the pullin' out my hair, gettin' mad times
Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own"
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
I used to be around more, but I was strapped for cash
And that's not attractive, workin' my ass off
Tryna make a success outta myself I guess
I could have been more present, but I was in a mess
I remember bein' on tour, stayin' up on the phone
30-minute conversation, "Boy, when you comin' home?
I can't be buildin' a family life here on my own"
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why you takin' that tone?
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stackin' up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm poppin' right now, but there will come a day when I won't

There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home (Yeah)

You know I just want your time (I just want your, I just want your time)

Love in Slow Motion
29 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsDeutschItalianoLove in Slow Motion Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's been a while since we been alone
To turn off the world and the telephone
I need to tell you you're beautiful
'Cause it's been a while and I apologize
I just get caught up in the rat race I'm runnin'
Chasin' a moment I'm hoping is comin'
If I stopped and took a look around
It's in front of my eyes, eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, let's slow down time
Maybe just press rewind
Darlin', that dress reminds
Me of the first time
[Chorus]
And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
[Verse 2]
It's been a while since it was you and me
Too many friends, too many evening drinks
Yeah, we commit to so many things
But not to ourselves, and I apologize
Sometimes, you're sad and you tell me it's nothin'
And I brush it off because there's always somethin'
But I need to change my perspective
And prioritise-ise

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause one thing I know is this
Every moment missed
Can be restored with your lips
It only takes one kiss
[Chorus]
And I wanna love tonight
One-on-one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
Love tonight
One-on-one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
Wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion

In slow motion
In slow motion

She's like cold coffee in the morning
I'm drunk off of last night's whiskey and coke
She'll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke

You can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

Tell me if I'm wrong

Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to

I'll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep

Stop The Rain
30 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoEspañolPortuguêsDeutschStop The Rain Lyrics[Verse 1]
Another human cloud to bring you down
When you blew the last away
And bring out a poisoned tongue or plastic crown
But for me, they look the same
Well, sometimes, it can get all too much for me
And that's why the photograph gets burned
Throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let the ones who hurt you see you cry
Tomorrow is another day
[Chorus]
You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretendin' that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
[Post-Chorus]
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Another "I, Me, Mine" to blur the lines
Between love and then heartbreak
Oh, it's a lonely life thinkin' you're right
And always shiftin' blame
And every time it's gettin' more and more ugly
And that's why the photograph gets burned
Throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let them tell you, "Keep it all inside"
I know the winds have got to change
[Chorus]
You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretendin' that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
[Post-Chorus]
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Bridge]
And it seems like time
Can be so much more than a wake-up call
And live real life
Every day is a chance that we can start over
Read my mind
There'll be ups and downs, but it won't change a thing
Between you and I
There's one thing I can't change
[Chorus]
You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretendin' that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretendin' that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel

You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Another room, another one
When morning comes, I'm running off
I found lust, but I wanna find love
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode
I don't know why, you're not enough
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long
But you never know though
'Cause maybe you could just be the one, ayy
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle
In the dark

Another night, another day
Been thinking 'bout it wide awake
I never thought I'd be alone
While everybody blowing up my phone
Don't trust no one, no, so don't want to get close
I get mine, I walk away

No lie, yeah, my mama always told me to be a bad girl
Never let anybody get in the way of what I'm trying to do now

When you need to figure shit out
And if I want you boy, I'ma tell you so
'Cause I'm the one in control, yeah

I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
And this tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo)

I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps, then that makes two
[Verse 2]
The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
And the shop across the road
Fills my needs and gives me company when I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo)

I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street

If the city never sleeps, then that makes two

And my lungs hurt and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts, but I need to move along

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home
[Chorus]
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps, then that makes two

I've been depressed since you left, tried to fill the hole with wine
Stopped the drugs when she came, cleaned my act up overnight
If you reach with no reply, I'll see you when I see you, man
You can't talk me through the fall if we don't know if I can land
Tried to grow, but the past, it tears me down to size
Tell the world how to process, but don't take the same advice
Half remember what I say, then the morning's filled with fear
Can't get a handle on my grief when every memory turns to tears
[Pre-Chorus]
It's been a long year
And we're not even halfway there
[Chorus]
Is this the endin' of our youth when pain starts takin' over?
I just don't know if I can ever just let it go
Everything's fallin' apart, when love is real, there's never closure
I guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but feel low
[Post-Chorus]
We spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open
And then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth
[Verse 2]
I've been lost since the teens, but pretend it's all alright
All my ups led to falls that led to trying to end my life
Just a boy at the start, they lent on like a man
You were meant to be my friend and not to take all that you can
Disengaged to create, try to reinvent the wheel
No one knows what they want, so I just give you what I feel
If I slip and get high, I know the low is always near
When I'm down, I never see you, when I'm up, you all appear

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been a long year
And we're not even halfway there
[Chorus]
Is this the endin' of our youth when pain starts takin' over?
I just don't know if I can ever just let it go
Everything's fallin' apart, when love is real, there's never closure
I guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but feel low

And then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth

Plastic Bag

I overthink and have trouble sleepin'
All purpose gone and don't have a reason
And there's no doctor to stop this bleedin'
So I left home and jumped in the deep end
Took a job for dad, I think, just to please him
So, when I quit, I just kept it secret
And I had friends, but no longer see them
And it's just me and, now, all my demons
[Pre-Chorus]
Are heavy, weighin' on my heart
I guess I'm done already, all but given up
I'm burnin' days till the weekends
And starts, I just pretend I'm not where I am
Should I cancel my plans?

Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rеly on the strobe lights
The lifеline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag
[Verse 2]
My friend died, it's been years, still grievin'
And I thought time would be somehow healin'
When love finds me, I'm too numb to feel it
Oh, why the fuck am I still here breathin'?
Well, I would pray, but I don't believe it
Oh, woe is me, but I don't care either
Life is not the way that it seems, but
Maybe this will all be a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll stay steady, balance on the rope
I guess that I'm not ready to rely on the hope
I'm burnin' days till the weekends
And starts, I just pretend I'm not where I am
Should I cancel my plans?

Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that

I'm a wreck-head, ah
Take me to the other side
Don't look in my eyes, oh, woah

It's almost mornin', I'm still not leavin'
It's wearin' off, but I still can feel it
Another one and I'll touch the ceilin'
This is all I want to be

[Chorus]
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that

And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes
[Chorus]
And dream
Hangin' out with the Sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hangin' out with the Sandman
Although there's rain outside, you'll bе warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my lovе
Hangin' out with the Sandman
[Verse 2]
Chocolate-covered roof and candy cars
Rainbow sugar river we can sail upon
Marshmallow books and strawberries
Snowmen made of ice cream
Over the flower fields, we'll fly
We'll count the fish in the sky
Honeybees and birds sing your song
Whatever you feel can never be wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes
[Chorus]
And dream
Hangin' out with the Sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hangin' out with the Sandman
Although there's rain outside, you'll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my love
Hangin' out with the Sandman
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Pre-Chorus]
Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes
[Chorus]
And dream
Hangin' out with the Sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hangin' out with the Sandman
Although there's rain outside, you'll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my love
Hangin' out with the Sandman

[Outro]
We're hangin' out with the Sandman
We're hangin' out with the Sandman
We're hangin' out with the Sandman
