Yeah
Wheezy outta here
[Verse 1: Drake]
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten, but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "Look up," 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D.​
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand-new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, "Yes, indeed"

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
Twenty-five hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the eighties
Me and Drake 'bout to drop, man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man, I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em go crazy
Wham-wham-wham, bitch, I'm the baby
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand-new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, "Yes, indeed"
Me and my dog goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate
Brand-new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, "Yes, indeed"
Me and my dog goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate

Run that back, Turbo
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Yeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind

Shoutout the whole Oakland City, man
You know what I'm saying? The whole 4PF
Know what I'm saying? I put this up
Yeah
[Verse]
Shoutout my label, that's me
I'm in this bitch with TB
I'm in this bitch with 4 Trey
I just poured up me an eight
Real nigga all in my face
Five hundred racks in my safe
Five hundred racks to the plug
What you know 'bout showin' love?
What you know 'bout pullin' up in Bentley trucks?
Make these bitches fall in love
All of my niggas on go
None of my niggas no ho
All of my niggas want smoke
All of my niggas together
We came from the bottom, we used to wear each other's clothes
None of my niggas gon' fold
Couple pussy niggas told
They ain't my niggas no more
Hold it down for the four
In the nine with the woes
Marlo my dawg, that's for sure
We won't fall out about shit
'Specially not 'bout no bitch
We ain't gon' fall out 'bout hoes
Me and Ced get them loads
We let 'em go for the low
I got my hood in control
I got my left wrist on froze
I got my right wrist on froze
I got my necklace on froze
Both of my ears on froze
I been gettin' faded, I'm sippin' on maple
If she won't fuck, I won't make her
I don't like bitches with makeup
If she want titties, I pay for 'em
Get outta that when I wake up
I pass the ball, I don't layup
I'm a big boss, I got say so
They'll wipe you down if I say so
Dracos on Dracos on Dracos on Dracos
40s on 40s on 40s
I just bought me some new water
Wetter than Katrina, shoutout New Orleans
I made a promise my niggas gon' ball
Hard in the paint, change my name to John Wall
Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall
Find a new plug then we takin' em all
Pull up in a brand new Benz truck
Hop out fresher than a menthol
Lil' nigga, but I'm big, dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Get a nigga block, took off
Cross a nigga up, Hot Sauce
Ooh, I got 'em mad, my fault
Talkin' 'bout the shit that I bought
Poppin' these Percs, I done turned to a savage
Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangster, but they won't approach me
I know they never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the gang to the fullest
I run with some real ones, don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer, don't push me
I see how you niggas be lurkin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life, I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a Vert with an Uzi
12 get behind me, I lose 'em
They tryna guess what I'm doin'
They tryna guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy
I been runnin' up them digits

Yeah

Oh, this the one right here, Wicked?
Okay
Yeah, yeah
Run that back, Turbo
[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you
[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)

Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you
[Verse 3]
Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)

Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong
[Chorus]
I'm like, "Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me"
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

[Verse 2]
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit

The track comes just days… Read More [Intro]
Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)
[Verse 1]
Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather

[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
[Verse 3]
They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah

[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

A love letter came through the mail, it said, "I miss you"
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OGs salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, "Of course"
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah

[Chorus]
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt
[Verse 2]
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a GOAT, I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it

[Chorus]
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault

You know Lil Ced, that's my nigga, I made him a millionaire, fuck it, we all rich
I ain't tryna have babies right now, so we fuck with the rubber, but I got a raw bitch
Know this money bring envy, you probably wan' be me, but bro, we can't beef 'bout no small shit
Overseas, got the crowd doin' moshpits
Can't believe that I'm still in the 'partments
Businessman, went and got me an office
Million-dollar deals, I get 'em often
Me and Dolla was servin' on Sparks Street
Hot lil' jit, he gon' stay with the chopstick
I got robbed, that shit made me a monster
Eviction notice, my sister, my mamas
Now they houses as big as they want 'em
I done ran up them motherfuckin' commas, look at lil' Dominique
Livin' like we in a race, I might come in first or second, but I won't ever be last
Lately, I been in my bag
Bro told me don't take my foot off the gas
If they give you a inch, go'n and take you a mile
I'ma shoot by myself like a technical foul
City to city, got girls goin' wild
Better not reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd
Lambo' so low, gotta squat
We finally made it, let's pop us some bottles
I took the lead and let everyone follow
They know I'm runnin' it right to the bank
They want me to ease up, I didn't leave 'em any breathin' room, sorry, I told 'em, "I can't"
Heard you a rat, so you know what's gon' happen whenever we catch you, I run with them snakes
Peep all the moves I been makin', by time I get forty, I gotta be one of them greats
Watch how I move with this paper, I know if I slip up one time they gon' try to come take it
Real as it get and these niggas be fakin', I don't want they vibes, so they hand I ain't shakin'
She on that '42 straight with no chaser
I'm tryna get out of here and go taste her, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, my diamonds be VV's (VV's)
They don't wan' see us on TV unless it's the news
I got somethin' to prove (Somethin' to prove)
Yeah, I'm young, but got somethin' to lose (Somethin' to lose)
In the street, I done paid all my dues (Yeah)
No extortion, ain't talking 'bout literally (Nah)
I be walkin' on beats, is you hearin' me? (Huh?)
I just pray that my kids be a bigger me, they can't get rid of me
My diamonds be VV's (VV's)
They don't wan' see us on TV unless it's the news

[Verse 2]
Wake up every day, somebody harrassin' me
I got rich, they need money, they askin' me
I was sittin' in jail, they ain't look out for me
Ones who need me them same ones who doubted me
I been handlin' my own, they can vouch for me
Head way down with me, know that she proud of me
Turn the heat up, ain't nobody hot as me
Everywhere dollars be, that's how I gotta be
I done gave her the world, now she not leavin'
Say she love me to death, told her, "Stop breathin'"
He try do what I do, but we not even
I want all of the beef, I am not vegan
Boy, you said it was smoke, nigga, stop speakin'
'Ventador, drop the top, I can't stop speedin'
Tryna see if this bitch hit the top speed
Hit the bitch from the back, have her knock knee
Call me Baby Hov, I control the rock
If the rap slow, I control the block
Yeah, I'm really it, and you niggas not
Got a couple coupes, I can drop the top
I done made it, nigga, all these digits comin' in
I'm savin' for the bigger picture, know one day I'll need 'em
Might as well get used to me
My biggest fear is endin' up a used-to-be, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, my diamonds be VV's (VV's)
They don't wan' see us on TV unless it's the news

New car very noisy
Come through and it's roarin'
Yeah, yeah
You know how I'm coming
You know how I'm coming
[Verse 1]
Bend her over, then I murk her
Call Gunna if you want you a Birkin
"Oh, Baby, you be lyin' in your verses
I be hearin', say you buyin' 'em purses"
I can't even lie, you ain't my type
You ain't even all that fine in person
I can guarantee you if you my kind
She got every bag you can imagine
Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, "What's happenin'?"
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
Giving looks, I contribute to fashion
Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper

[Chorus]
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah
Matter of fact, none of you guys get high as me, woah
Post my drip up daily just so they can see, woah
Turn me up some more so my haters can hear it, woah (Yeah)
[Verse 2]
I put the dope in the back of the car and I tell 'em to go
She hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road
She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit
I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it
I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless
If you tell 'em what was said, you a rodent
Drive the new Corvette like it's stolen, yeah

[Chorus]
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah
Matter of fact, none of you guys get high as me, woah

Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Ayy, yeah
Tay Keith, this too hard
Ring, ring, ring, we drip too hard, ayy
(Run that back, Turbo)
Yeah, ayy, look
[Verse 1: Drake]
I bring up money, they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
She gave me her number, now I gotta block it
I'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit
[Interlude: Gunna]
Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap
[Verse 2: Drake]
I bring up hits and they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
One hell of a year and a nigga still droppin'
They wanted to stop it, but they couldn't stop it
You told a story like shorty was feelin' you
She told a story like she split the bill with you
Look at my story, man, no one could write it
Now I see a million, I don't get excited
I might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way
Ain't no real sense in me goin' the other way
Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway
Please don't be stupid, it's Baby and Gunna
And Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her
Next time I'm in Dallas, I'll look for another
You niggas fell off and you'll never recover

[Verse 3: Gunna]
Poured up some Hi-Tech and wait 'til it bubble
Young Gunna Gunna, I make this shit double
Hit Eliantte and left with a puddle
It's me, Drake, and Baby, you know you in trouble
Run up my check, my bitch sprinted the shuttle
Sign plus an M, bought a Benz for my brother
Painted all black, the interior butter
I drip like a leak and that's word to my mother (Shh-shh)
Yeah, came out the street, gotta sleep with a cutter
Family a beast, we gon' eat us a supper
My dick in her mouth like she teethin' or somethin'
Sound like it could be Drip Season or somethin'
Ain't no comparin' 'cause we number one
In black and white Chanel, I look like a nun
The police in shock, don't know who got a gun
Don't got what I got 'cause I shop in Milan
It's winter, I still took the top off the Dawn
The kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
I know you upset that I'm shinin' in the sun
Cuban link look like a box of crayons
I'm still at the lot, tryna cop the Cayenne
I told the judge, "Fuck it", I'm goin' on the run
You one of my dawgs, I'll look out for the bond
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Let 'em get by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y’all dick ride
Breadwinner like I'm Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I don't get tired
From the trenches, now I'm goin'
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch

[Verse 4: Lil Baby]
Don't gotta drip, I can leave it to Gunna
Runnin' this shit, only been out two summers
That 4x4 truck, I post 300
Go at whoever, they know how I'm comin'
Ain't got no feelings, I'm here for the money
Treat every club like a Magic on Monday
Niggas ain't rich for real, they gettin' fronted
Gave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach
By the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shipped it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like I'm Usher
If she tell me "No" once, I won't even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money ain't even came in from the other one
Fuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a number one
They tryna team up to beat me, they huddlin' up
Ever catch me out in traffic, I'm cuttin' up
Every city we go to, it be lit as fuck
Tryna put the police on us, get rid of us

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Let 'em get by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y’all dick ride
Breadwinner like I'm Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I don't get tired
From the trenches, now I'm goin'
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch

Forever

I know you miss me
Who it's gon' be if it ain't me, lil' baby?
I'm in your city
'Cause I need it one more time
Might lose it all, I swear
I need it tonight, ooh, ah
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
How we get so deep so fast?
Bae, stop playin', I'll beat your ass
You be on some toxic shit but I cannot get off this bitch, I
Haven't seen you in three months, I miss you, can I see you, bae?
Every time I see one of your pictures, that shit drives me crazy
Girl, I know you miss a nigga
Especially how I kiss it
Message say delivered
Why the fuck you keep goin' missing on me?
Every time he get back in the picture, you act different on me
Ayy, tell that nigga we gon' have to share you, I ain't trippin' on it
One more time might be the best for both of us
Maybe we should talk about it later when we sober up
Maybe we should keep it goin', maybe we should let it go
Feel like if it's meant it's what it is so just let it flow
Got somethin' to handle so I'ma be here for a couple hours
Figured out you like them, my assistant keep on sendin' flowers
They got they own business, tell me why the fuck they all in ours?
Mama raised a lot of things but she ain't raised no fuckin' coward
We went to the moon last time, I'm tryna go back
We been doin' our thing for a while but they don't know that
I be buyin' you all type of bags but you can't show that
I be playin' the cut until you come back

[Chorus: Fridayy]
I know you miss me
Who it's gon' be if it ain't me, lil' baby?
I'm in your city
'Cause I need it one more time
Might lose it all, I swear
I need it tonight, ooh, ah
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Thinkin' how we played out
Really I feel off about it but ain't never said it
We ain't gotta talk about it
They'll never know when I'm with you, I play a different role
Can't move off emotion, this shit deep now I got self-control
I ain't never tried to hold you, niggas try to high and low me
I can break it down in dumbest terms and show you how you owe me
Still try and back door me, I know how to go about it
I know everything but I treat you like I don't know about it
Wildin' in Skyami, we took shrooms and caught a different vibe
Bitches can't fuck with you, you the one, for real, I peep your style
I gotta get to it, I'm OT so it's gon' be a while
It feel a lil' better when I ain't seen you, yeah
[Chorus: Fridayy]
I know you miss me
Who it's gon' be if it ain't me, lil' baby?
I'm in your city
'Cause I need it one more time
Might lose it all, I swear
I need it tonight, ooh, ah

Bustdown Rollies for the clique
Got these bitches dancing on the dick
They gon' wait in line for this drip
I'ma give her mine, then dip
I'ma try to kill her for the real
Thirty thousand dollars in my ear
I ain't gotta sign no deal
Made a half a mil' last year
I just came home from the can
Twenty days, whole hundred bands
Got a nigga feelin' like the man
All these bitches knowin' who I am
Hit the ground runnin', I ain't playin'
Put a hundred bricks in the van
Give a thousand pounds to my man
Blow the money fast as I can
Signed to the streets, no advance
Bitches tryna rip me out my pants
'Cause they heard a youngin' gettin' bands
They don't know that I ain't goin' for nothin'
Only gave the bitch a couple hundred
Big dawg, nigga, you a runner
Run off on the plug, change my number
Drop-top coupes for the summer

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's my dawg for sure (My dawg)
Yeah, that's my dawg (My dawg)
Yeah, that's my dawg for sure (My dawg)

Got a lotta new flames, still need them blue
Three hundred fifty thou', times that by two
New Dawn, no roof, I still see the sky
Peace to my grandma, I can still see my guys
Turned his back, must've felt let down
Heard I'm down seven hundred, what you gon' bet now?
Yeah, I used to be a twerp, bitch, a vet now
Luke, get up, doggy, I need you
Only nigga made sure that I was eatin'
Free Nef still, nigga, RIP Reese
Get her nails done, still charge for the feature
Baby, we ain't that, nah, we ain't this
All that fuckin', I don't do no kissin'
Bitches ain't shit, word to my niggas
All in my mentions (Damn)
Bitch really wanna get hired
Tell the lil' hoes I'm Bryson
I done hit more shit than Mike Tyson
Get popped, nigga, I ain't doin' no fightin'
Sinnin' 'bout cash, I ain't doin' no right
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Car too fast, can't stop at no light
I hit the gas, it skrrt, then I pull off
I'm on they ass, I just took a year off
She shakin' her ass, call me when she get off
Took half a mil' for my lil' bro to get out
That new Richard Mille made me feel like a boss
Feel like I'm Meech when I'm ridin' in these cars
Who you know pull up whole entourage in a foreign?
I got designer for days, but it's somethin' about 'em
Go crazy for white Air Force 1's, maybe 'cause I'm a dope boy
He be loud, but he ain't makin' no noise
'Ventador on the ground like a skateboard
If I want it, I get it, I pay for it
I pay extra, I ain't tryna wait for it
Everything that I got, it was made for me
I was servin' them trap houses faithfully
Everybody with me gotta eat
Say your grace with me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah
[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Right back on it, designer my garments
Corner store mornings, there until the sun down
I don't trust no one, I can't put my gun down
Goin' number one now, hottest out, hands down
Bands out, pants down, yeah, I'm thuggin'
I done got rich, everybody my cousin
You ain't servin' no packs with me, you ain't my brother
That chopper go through shit, I call it the cutter
I just bought a new whip, I went bought another
My mother, she happy now
Ain't no cap and gown, but I graduated
Her house paid for, and that new Mercedes
Know you see that they been tryna be me lately
I'm a heavy hitter like Gervonta Davis
That shit ain't gon' save 'em, leave 'em on the pavement
All I know is get this motherfuckin' paper

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name (Hello?)
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah
[Verse 4: 42 Dugg]
Bitches ain't shit, doggybone, I get it
Fell in love twice, had me in my feelings
Three months, dropped damn near a half a million
Nigga, fuck a house, I done damn lost a building
Fucked a nigga's ho, so he say he wanna kill me
I miss Tev, this shit was different
I miss Nef, rest in peace to my niggas
Damn near went deaf, when they told me they killed you
Turn rat? Nigga, fuck on
Thirteen thou' VVS buffs on
Still'll flood a nigga town with a truckload
Get the head, I'm out, I don't trust hoes
If the feds in the house, a nigga told on me
I pray to God my soul to keep
G5 just beat his murder
Body got picked up, doggy I'm hurt
Still pay the lawyer even though I'm nervous

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change

Pure Cocaine

When your wrist like this, you don't check the forecast
Every day it's gon' rain, yeah

From the streets, but I got a little sense
But I had to go coupe, no brain (Coupe, no brain)
Ain't worried 'bout you, I'ma do what I do

Bought her brand new shoes, told her kick rocks
Don't stand too close, diamonds kickbox
Think red means go so I don't stop
I know they wish they could catch me, but keep wishin'
You think I done turned into a fiend for these bitches
Tryna stuff as much as I can in these britches
Made your bitch fuck on my friend, it's no difference
I ain't never popped no Xan, I sip sizzurp
If I ever have to tell on the gang, I won't do it
If I put it on a song, I seen it or been through it
I can't put it in my song, I know how the feds move
Scream free all of the ahks but I ain't no FamGoon
Gave my mama ten bands, sent her to Cancún
Got the crowd goin' dumb but I ain't no damn fool
If I went in there and did it and made it, you can too
We done came a long way from broke and sharing shoes

I'm living my best life for real
Just left the dealership, no tag
If we opposite, it won't work, it won't last
Get an opposite knocked off, toe tag
Ain't been home in a month, got my ho mad
They need me in the trap but I can't go back
I jumped off the porch with a hundred dollar slab
I got M's in the bank, give a damn what they think
Every vibe I ever shot my shot at, caught it
Everything you ever seen me riding in, bought it
Big dawg status, I ain't gotta sell drugs
Put my craft into rap then I took off, yeah
New G-Wagen, no key, this a push-start
I can hit the gas, make it disappear

Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
[Chorus: Gunna]
In that fast thing, speedin' through the city (Skrrt, skrrt)
Panoramic brain, and my dash digi' (Dash digi')
Motherfuck the fame, all my niggas litty (Lit)
Backwood to the face, I don't smoke no Philly (Nah)
Drip, drippin' sauce like I'm chili (Sauce)
Let that mink hang to the floor when it's chilly (It's chilly)
I got three big booty broads at the Telly (The Telly)
And they know from the start who was ready
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I can't fuck with none of y'all niggas, y'all disgust me
When you with your maggot ass friends, don't discuss me
FN with extended clip, I hope them try to rush me
I hear 'em sayin' such and such, a nigga ain't gon' touch me
Big body Benz, 'member I used to be dusty
Now I want my money all hundreds in a rush please
I was sellin' weed when they came out with White T
Now I put a whole half a ticket on my white tee
Whole hood poppin', other niggas, they don't like me
Made her eat it up, she told her friend, "He gon' wife me"
All my niggas thoroughbred, I don't fuck with crossbreeds
Free all of the bros down the road and on Rice Street

[Chorus: Gunna]
In that fast thing, speedin' through the city (Skrrt, skrrt)
Panoramic brain, and my dash digi' (Dash digi')
Motherfuck the fame, all my niggas litty (Lit)

I got three big booty broads at the Telly (The Telly)
And they know from the start who was ready (Ready)
[Verse 2: Gunna]
Put some fine bitches in Margiel-y's (Margiel-y)
Two new glass tinted, these baguette-y's (Baguette-y)
Ain't gon' bash you bitches, I ain't petty (Nah)
Just know we fuckin', we ain't goin' steady (Goin' steady)
I don't wanna sleep, I need more Addys (Need more Addy)
I ain't have no kid but I'm her daddy (I'm her daddy)
Better shake her ass like it's Magic (Like it's Magic)
Twenties in my pocket look like cabbage (Yeah)
Carats everywhere, I'm a rabbit (I'm a rabbit)
I ain't Shawty Lo, but what's happenin'? (What's happenin'?)
We was taught to go, keep that cannon (That cannon)
I'm on fuckin go, I can't panic (I can't panic)

[Outro: Lil Baby]
Money conversations, check my feng shui
I buy Dolce Gabbana, Chanel a month straight
Supermodel, her body gon' be my entree
I been runnin' with hitters, my youngins gun slang
Cars up to date, brand new Wraith
My life circle, mines ain't straight
Bills ain't late, paid no notes
I ain't no joke, they want smoke
We exotic, start a riot, we gon' ride
.223's, drakes outside
We don't get tired, we gon' die

We ain't talked in like a week straight
I been all on the interstate
I been tryna go and get this cake
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all them niggas
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas
[Verse 1]
They thinkin' I lost it, remind them niggas
I can get flyer than niggas
Hundred thousand in a Gucci bookbag, they thinkin' I signed a nigga
I leveled my life up, this Rollie I got on don't tick tock
Still on that bullshit, if you pull up on me, let the stick talk
I'm in L.A. with the vibes, they in the cut getting high
She tryna get in my ride, she tryna turn up tonight, yeah
I was running up cash, yeah, I had ran up a bag
And they started gettin' mad, yeah
But I didn't get mad, I just kept getting cash, yeah
Now I'm in my bag, yeah, now I'm in my bag, yeah
She wanna get with me, she know that I'm sticky, but I'm in my bag now
She wasn't fucking with me, she didn't come around, she wishing she had now
And I'm in my bag now
I'm in the bag, the Goyard to be exact
Three hundred racks inside it, and that ain't no cap
I could've bought a Wraith today, yeah yeah
I ran it up, they supposed to hate
I'm digging this lifestyle
Water drippin' on me like I'm a faucet
The crew with me right now
You can play, just proceed with caution
I popped the wrong pill, now I'm nauseous
I need to get off this drank, it's a problem
I took a Tesla and landed on Mars​
Lord please wake me up tomorrow

[Chorus]
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all a nigga
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all a nigga
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas
[Verse 2]
They know they can't beat me, so they tryna leave me
And she tryna leave me, but I ain't gon' let her
Diamonds on Fiji, I'm running with QC
And Reebok endorse me, went up a new level
I'm loving this lifestyle and niggas wanna be me
I know they won't catch up, but I ain't gon' let 'em
As soon as the money get up to a million, put it in the ground and then go buy a new shovel
How you gon' be in yo feelings when I'm in my feelings?
We both can't be in our feelings
I ain't gon' lie when you thinkin' I did it, I did it
It's something 'bout your intuition
Ain't telling you no lies, I'm tired of seeing you cry
Come here girl, let me wipe your eye
Everything gon' be alright, yeah

[Chorus]
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all a nigga
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all a nigga
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas

(Tay Keith, this too hard)
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I paid some extra before we even come out
And don't even wear it to show I ain't playin'
I hit the bitch and I gave her some racks
And I pull up my pants, she know I ain't stayin'
Go on a store run and get rubber bands
I done got rich, I done put on my mans
Choppers in traffic, that's just how I'm livin'
They say that I'm trippin', they wouldn't understand
She take a trip, she come back with a tan
I take a trip, I come back with them bands
When I was dealin', it really was killin' 'em
Had 'em competin', tryna see what I'm payin'
She throw a hoodie on soon as we land
She don't like pics, I got too many fans
I'm runnin' shit, I can do what I want
And it's really a limit, you do what you can
I found the booth and I put that shit up
'Fore I run out of cash, they gonna run out of land
I fell in love with this bitch 'cause her head was amazing
I swear I don't even know her name
I'm 'bout to takeoff, I gave 'em a chance
They gave me ten M&M's on advance
Thought I'd be trappin' forever, but God came and blessed me
I guess it was part of the plan
How he on fire, but he cool as a fan?
Can't get at you, we gon' get at your man
They can relate to me 'cause I be poppin' it
Put in they face, let 'em see what I'm sayin'
I'm rockin' shows like I play with a band
Free all the bros, know I would if I can
If I don't mean it, I swear I ain't sayin' it
'Fore I was 21, swear I was savage, smashin'

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me
Not the fans, yeah, the haters
Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial, I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position, who doin' that?
[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
We got FN with extensions, we throwin' that
Her ass got my full attention, she throwin' that
Niggas talkin' way too much, I ain't goin' back
And forth with niggas 'cause these niggas be holdin' racks
On the real, yeah, we know you don't own them racks
Four pockets full, push 'em down, they start pokin' back
I turned eight million right until I'm a quarterback
Spent a million like I'm tryna bring Kobe back (24, woo)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I use the crockpot like it's Betty
They say the drop hot and it's ready
Might stretch it out, but it ain't fetti (Yes)
Say my dawg doin' time
But I know he ain't gonna snitch 'cause it's still some shit he didn't tell me
My dawg stabbed his celly
He told me the whole story over the celly (Brr, hello?)
Went up on my price, in my pocket like Kelly
Fucked her in the telly, no I can't not say who, no telly
My head gettin' heavy
And you know I still got Balmains on my ass (Woo)
No, I can't do no Amiris
Said I'm takin' trips, long flights, they scary
She said her birthday in March, okay, cool, so that means you an Aries
I told her, "Gotta go," she said, "You serious?"
Diamonds cold as December, my vibe Sagittarius

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up (Haha, period, period, slatt, woo)
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me
Not the fans, yeah, the haters
Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial, I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position, who doin' that?
[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I can switch up and come back another way
If the vibe ain't right, come back another day
Biggest dripper, I start up a tidal wave
Remix weed, we put it in a microwave
Batch for twenty-three like I know Michael J
He can say what he want, but he gotta pay
Used to hide all the guns where my mama stay
Sell my drugs 'round the corner
I pay all these bills, I'm a grownup
My cars a lil' different, I own 'em
I ain't with no leasin', my bitch tellin' me I need credit
It's loud and clear if I said it
I come from the gutter, I spent me a hundred on Chevys
You can take me out the hood, but you can't take the hood out of me
Know the hood proud of me
I Givenchyed my tee, went and upgrade my teeth
Yeah, I dropped out of school, but that paper on me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me
Not the fans, yeah, the haters
Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial, I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position, who doin' that?

People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, "Baby keep it solid"
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, "Lay low"
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco
AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
[Verse 2]
Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, "Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, "Don't tell hoes where you stay at"
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

4PF look like we hit licks how we sell bricks
We don't sell shit, we just make hits, yeah
Turn up
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Keepin' my composure, never sober
Never chokin', always smokin doja
Fuck 'em if they gettin' over
Got a Moncler coat because the kid the coldest
I ain't changed, I stayed the same and maintained
It's safe to say the kid gettin' older
Forever gang, I'm never switchin' over
Made a lane and niggas can't get over
I can't match with rappers, they be bogus
Really get a pack and keep the over
Big dripper, stand up in the ocean
Everybody trappin', we get loads in
He ain't 4PF if he ain't got motion
Made a half a ticket off promotion
Shout out Swishers Sweet, they keep me rollin'
But if we catch the opp, we gotta smoke him
Ridin' 'round with Dracs like we OVO
I got some racks and I want some more
Still got them passin' the hood, call it give-and-go
Keep a nigga main bitch in a figure-four
Let me fuck when I want, I just come and go
Man, these racks gettin' too big for these skinny clothes
I might put me an M in some big Girbaud
Let lil' bro hit the stick, had start gettin' old
I spent five hundred racks on a Lambo'
And didn't even know how to make that motherfucker go
On my birthday, I just wanna lift the door
Barely flex, but don't play with me, period
Shooters follow behind in a Urus
In the Rolls truck, I feel like a tourist
I'm the one from the bottom who sold all my partners them pounds
Used to drive in a Buick

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gunna]
Hot, hot, hot, I'm heatin' up
I fuck with slimes and I'm gonna bust (Bah, bah)
He can't put on that drip, he ain't one of us
How you ridin' in a Benz and a Tonka truck?
How you got everybody lit, pipin' up?
Oh, she bad with no swag, I can pipe her up
Made my last one my last one, I'm wifin' her
Count the money up fast like I'm typin' somethin'
I'm the type to get active and never run (Wunna)
[Verse 2: Gunna]
Keep the Rugers, my niggas ain't scared of nothin' (Nah)
And ain't no rules, you got racks, you can get it done (Yeah)
On a light day, I keep me a honey bun (One hundred)
Makin' hit after hit, call me Barry Bonds (Hits)
For this Christmas, I bought everybody guns (Swear)
Glocks and choppers and FN's for everyone (Grrat)
Take that roof off the car, let her feel the sun (Wow)
My bro go see his barber five times a month (Yeah)
Got this bitch out the college, she suckin' and swallow (Uh)
I stick it in, she feel it in her gut (In her gut)
We don't run from our problems, we stackin' up guala and guala I'm tryna get that mega bucks (Racks)
We them drippers, lil' nigga, best watch your step (Them drippers)
This top shelf, got forty designer belts (Drip)
4PF look like the new BMF
Think I'm deaf, got stones in my right and left (Ice)
How you crank up the car? Ain't no key in there
Just pull up, spin they block, and get out of there (Get out of there)
Wake up, have a hard time findin' what to wear
Treat these hoes like a tire, I keep a spare
Want a strap because I'm war ready (War)
Check the trust account, it's more fetti (Yeah)
Skydweller, Jubilee, and a Presi' (No cap)
Hundred-fifty plain Richard Millie (No cap)
I'ma milk the game until it's empty
Lil cuzzo spit that flame until it's empty (Yeah)
I am not a killer, but don't tempt me (Nah)
Spendin' rate 'bout thousand to a fifty

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Hot, hot, hot, I'm heatin' up
I fuck with slimes and I'm gonna bust (Bah, bah)
He can't put on that drip, he ain't one of us

Any time I fuck her I hit from the back end
I'm pullin' her hair while I dig in her
She like hold up baby, keep my tracts in
I can't hit that bitch raw, got a glove on me
I'm in the trap with the drugs on me

Youngin from the project fucked around and got it poppin
I'm like fuck a Maserati, bought my bitch a Bentley truck

And me, I got Chanel swag, you know I be C'd up
I paid cash for every car, used be the laughing stock
Kept it real, that's why I don't flock
Look at me, I'm on the chart
I don't look down but I'm on top
I don't entertain any clout
Play with me, you gon' get shot for real
Now they can't resist us, hear 'em tryna diss us
Really need to miss us, prolly with your bitch, bruh
I bought her purse off a piece of my endorsement
Richer than my classmates, she know how my kids taste
Now I'm on this cash race, I can't come in last place
I done finally went legit, accountants, I'm a taxpayer
So you know that mean I'm goin' hard 'til my last day
Still can get a thousand pounds a week, the gas way
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I got six watches, I'm ahead of time
I’m goin' all out if it's 'bout mine
I’m gettin' my shine on, I been on my grind
Feel like I'm different, I'm one of a kind
Buy her a Birkin Bag, keep her up to par
Baby, you look better naked, you should take it off
Had to play my role, now I'm takin' charge
Just got off parole, made the brodie take the charge

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Bendin' through in that Phantom with them sticks, yeah (Skrrt, skrrt)
All these blues, niggas asking am I Crip yet? (Cuzzo)
Make a move we X you out, ain't goin' tic tac (Brrt)
Put a tag on your toe for all that chit chat (Yeah, yeah)
The richest nigga in my city, that's a big fact (Big fact)
And we don't do them lil' planes, we on the big jet (Big jet)
My dawg still movin' that 'caine, and he ain't quit yet (He ain't quit yet)
I had to tell him when he came, "Don't bring no bricks back"
Feel like I'm the chosen one (Woah)
Rolls truck, I ordered one (Woah)
I ain't mean to buy that bitch a watch, but I bought her one (Ah)
Richard Millie cost a quarter milli', I got more than one (Yeah)
FN on me lighter than a bitch, feel like a water gun (Gang)
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I got six watches, I'm ahead of time
I’m goin' all out if it's 'bout mine

Livin' like a pornstar

Opps finna join us but we ain't switching sides
Neck look like a freezer, ain't savin' no skeezer
They gave me a reason, now they gotta die
I don't want no smoke with you if you don't want no smoke with me
But dawg if you want smoke with me, we switchin' shifts, sleep and creep
I did what they couldn't do, guess that's why they mad at me
But what's up with yo vibe, dawg, why she keep on addin' me?
This my strategy
Keep on stackin' Gs, make 'em proud of me
I went Prada Tees, I went Prada jeans
I want Prada fleece, I'm from poverty
Real talk

I got six watches, I'm ahead of time
I’m goin' all out if it's 'bout mine
I’m gettin' my shine on, I been on my grind

Buy her a Birkin Bag, keep her up to par
Baby, you look better naked, you should take it off
Had to play my role, now I'm takin' charge
Just got off parole, made the brodie take the charge

I can do bad on my own and good by myself

My nigga got caught, I just hope he don’t tell
If you can sit quiet then I’ll pay your bail
They not gon' snitch if they send me to hell
I put in overtime to get these M’s
Been with the same gang since I was lil'

You won’t believe what I made in a year
I’m flippin' these bags, I made me a mill
Then I start rappin' and got me a deal
I took off fast, this shit get for real
She want to talk but she don’t want to hear
All she want me to do is keep it real
She keep on cryin' I'm tired of her tears
I keep on lyin' it just what it is
I'm on my grind, so fuck how you feel
I got some homies who sittin' in the pen

They gon' be sittin' in that bitch for some years
We were some teens, they labeled us grown
Had some judges who doin' us wrong
I know your pain just hold on
Just sing this song

I can do bad on my own and good by myself
I never needed no help
I needed you niggas, you wasn’t right there
You need me, lil' nigga, I’m still gon' be here

Heyy

Yeah
[Verse 1]
My favorite bitch just cut me off and she won't even let me know the reason (Yeah)
It's probably one of her lil' messy hatin'-ass friends bein' evil
I ain't stressin' 'bout it, she'll come around when she wanna eat it up
Slow stroke, fast stroke, grindin' it, I'm a real pleaser
Sixty hoes in New York havin' dinner
Bottega send it to me soon as they get it
I put Maybach seats in the Sprinter
Make sure evеrybody sit comfortable
You gotta really pay attention, I'm not mumblin'
Shе tryna have a good time, she wanna come with us
They know we can't be fucked with, they not one of us
It's done been some times I slipped, I'm not fallin'
Brabus baby blue, the inside too, I'm feelin' like a kid again
They thought I got lucky last time, fuck it, I'm back on that shit again
Her last bag was a crocodile Kelly
Got it chocolate to match her skin
I just gave bro a hundred pounds of wham
Told him, "Tell the city it's in"
Majority of the time, I "Hi" and "Bye," these niggas
I ain't with all that lockin' in shit
Money over everything, try to stop it
You get popped right then and there
Message thread full of, "Where you ats?" and "Pull up on me"
Bunch of whens and wheres
Youngins out here wildin' with no guidance
All they care about is who they kill
I was tryna keep that shit in order
It got harder 'cause I'm never there
It's a better life out here
I promise, brodie, I'ma keep it in they ear
I know how it feel to spin a opp
But it feel way better to count a million
I come from the bottom of the bottom
I shot right up through the fuckin' ceilin'

[Chorus]
Hey (Hey-hey-hey)
Everybody lit, can't put our fire out (Hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)
Hey (Hey-hey-hey)
Soon as it pop, bro pull that fire out (Hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, stay down, hustle hard until you come up
Take some, only when you need it
You won't make it far bein' greedy
My grandma taught me how to be a leader
If we fly commercial, we got greeters
They just know that we important people
They see how we comin', think we ghetto
Until they children tell 'em I'm their hero
Flight attendant said I look familiar
Crack a smile, tell her, "It's a small world"
Oh, that's your bitch? That's my ho too
We gon' share her, call her, "Our girl"
Real street music, I ran that field
If you can hit that, then she ain't my girl
Get your lick back, come step in my world
Two bitches on the same itinerary
The same flight, same hotel, they don't even know each other yet (Yeah)
One of 'em don't say nothin', the other askin', "Do we go together yet?"
Young turnt nigga, ain't no holdin' back
This a Brabus, bro, not a regular wagon
I don't kiss and tell, I ain't into that
I don't think I met a nigga colder yet, like

Everybody lit, can't put our fire out (Hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)

Spent six hunnid eatin' lunch (No cap), got tired of honey buns (Ayy)
Smokin' by the ton (Ayy), give a fuck about my lungs (Ayy)
She suck me sloppy (Yeah), put my lil' 'babies on her tongue
In the hotel lobby (Yeah), got a Glock on me with a drum (Yeah)
Half a mil' in jewelry, got a quarter in my safe (Yeah)
She don't ask me nothin' (Yeah), put my main bitch in her place (Yeah)
Take her shoppin' I got good taste (Good taste), I approve her fit of the day
You ain't goin' out like that, no way (No), I drip too hard every day (Drip)
[Chorus: Gunna & Lil Durk]
Shoppin' spree for fun, she did Saint Laurent (Uh)
Alexander, Laurent (Yah), private flight to Milan ('Lan)
Ice VVs (Ice, ice), ice VS1s (Ice VS1s)
Off-White, Vlone 1's, foreigns parked in my lawn
Them 40s come with drums, I like my bitches blonde
Wockhardt give me the runs, don't none of my hoes wear Uggs
If you go on a hit, you can't call off, name hold weight, can't raw dog
Off Percs and X, can't nod off, if I call you the plug, you can't fall off

Hats Off
110 ContributorsTranslationsРусскийHats Off Lyrics[Intro]
What's happenin', Chi Chi?
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Turn my name to "The kiDD," that's a baby goat
Keep a Drac' like I started up OVO
You can get a percent, but I want the most
Got a house with a lake, so I bought a boat
'Bout to switch up a play, that's an audible
State-to-state, private jet with some model hoes
Had to run up more dollars than followers
Me and bae take the week off in Cabo
Life's a gamble, I'm playin' the lotto
I'm bettin' it all 'cause I know that I got 'em
'Member me? I was drivin' Impalas
We don't beef, if it's problems, we solve it
I remember that deucе deuce revolvеr I bought for my partna
He died in a argument
They was hatin', that's why I'm way farther than 'em
'Member askin' my mom where my father been at
Ain't no talkin', that fire what I'm tryna get at
Niggas cuffin' these hoes that the crew done been had
Get them racks out the bank, put it right in the bag
Say he wouldn't do that, but he would if he can
Hop out marchin' with drums like we play in the band
I come straight out the mud, I ain't been in no sand
Twenty-hour flight, had popped me a Xan
I got horny, almost fucked on a fan
I had thinked about it, I can't end up on Shade Room
Everything that I hit, I done paid for
She know what I can bring to the table
I can tell if it's real by the label
We had TV, but we didn't have cable
Now I'm richer than all of my neighbors

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Baby]
I wear my chain proud, it's a trophy
I'm with the same crowd, these the brodies
I don't got the same mind, you don't know me
You don't gotta do it loud, keep it low-key
I'm tryna be here for mine, I can't hold you
The Forgiatos twenty-four, this for Kobe
I shouldn't have to say, you know that you owe me
You ain't gotta search, you know that it's on me
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Hats off if you keepin' it real
It's so easy to fall victim to fake
Durk the voice 'cause he know just what to say
I'm the hero, I come through, save the day
Hats off if you keepin' it real
It's so easy to fall victim to fake
Durk the voice 'cause he know just what to say
I'm the hero, I come through, save the day
[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Bitch, I'm a D-boy, do it for T.Roy
I'm on you forever, that's just word to V.Roy
I'm with the killas forever, the trenches is in me
The Grammys can't change me for nothin'
I like the bitches who let me just offer them cash
You never gon' ask me for nothin'
Never gon' switch
Only time I ever switch is a Glock with a motherfuckin' button
Rappers be runnin' back, tellin' them bitches we hittin'
That's why we don't be tellin' them nothin'
4TF, Only the Family
But Four Pockets Full, but we keep it a hundred
That shit solid, I done took losses
I done turned robbers to killers and bosses
I been that nigga from way, way back
Way before Uzi was droppin' the cross
We just a family, we never recruitin'
Clique full of killas, we choosin' to shoot 'em
Someone tell Kanye and Kim to just stick to the script
And just tell 'em to free Larry Hoover
Me, I'm the voice, Baby, the hero
Trav like Michael Jackson, yeah
Been in it a minute, it's crazy I'm winnin'
It only feel like I've been rappin' a year
Let a nigga play with me, I'm ready
My bitch gettin' rich off cosmetics
Life off, they done freed my daddy
Lights off, I couldn't see my baby
2010, I had a gun in my Pelle
2011, I was fightin' my celly
2012, I signed my deal in Cali
2021, I'm big as Khaled, oh-woah

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Baby]
I wear my chain proud, it's a trophy
I'm with the same crowd, these the brodies
I don't got the same mind, you don't know me
You don't gotta do it loud, keep it low-key
I'm tryna be here for mine, I can't hold you
The Forgiatos twenty-four, this for Kobe
I shouldn't have to say, you know that you owe me
You ain't gotta search, you know that it's on me
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Hats off if you keepin' it real
It's so easy to fall victim to fake
Durk the voice 'cause he know just what to say
I'm the hero, I come through, save the day
Hats off if you keepin' it real
It's so easy to fall victim to fake
Durk the voice 'cause he know just what to say
I'm the hero, I come through, save the day
[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
(Yeah) After this drop, then it's only the label
You see the crosses surroundin' the table
But never cross us, we flip ya, Alfredo
Bro do it silent without a potato
I took the logic and built out a payroll
All the whips chocolate, I built it like LEGOs (Let's go)
I leave him deceased (Yeah)
Only way that they ever find peace (Yeah)
In that case, then I might need a priest (Yeah)
In the streets, gotta keep the belief
Not a wave, gotta keep you a sea (Sea)
Look for me, gotta keep you a fee (Fee)
Made a hundred and put it on gold (It's lit)
Took the steppas and put 'em on roll (Straight up)
It's a lotta them ridin' and glidin' and slidin' that's ready to snatch up your soul (Yeah)
I was eighteen still when I got my deal, then Dre had to go up the road (Up the road)
Now he back outside and see lil' bro, he got believers
R.I.P. Big Tone, I know you see us
Sorry, gotta fuck on the low, I can't make Cheaters
Dawg, we got it bussin' out the bleachers (Yeah)
It's jumpin' like wall to wall

[Outro: Travis Scott & Lil Durk]
(Trav like Michael Jackson, yeah)
(The truth, see, see)

How

(M-M-M-Murda)
[Verse 1]
Runnin' up this money been a breeze (Phew)
Flew her in, she fuck me ’til she leave (Uh)
She done fell in love, I'm sellin' dreams
I done fell in love with buyin’ jeans (Jeans)
Hate I found a love for sippin' lean
Hellcat faster than a Demon, new G-Wagen with no key
Put baguettes in my AP, I ain't on playin' about they beef
Niggas know I play for keeps, treat my brothers like they me
Had to make myself a boss, it ain't no nigga workin' me
I invest a couple mil' and let my money work for me
Know they hate the way it happened, probably somewhere cursin' me
I don’t know nothing ’bout no killin', all I know is murder beats
I got rich and understand my next three cars gon’ be a lease
I ain't never losin' sleep about no beef, I roll in peace
I put diamonds in my teeth, came from grindin' in the streets
Get a load and break it down and sell it all and then repeat it
Pray to God for all the dawgs behind the wall, they need they freedom (Free y’all)
When I be on TV and perform, I hope they see me (See me)
Once it's up, it's stuck, we get over on niggas, not get even
Forgiato rims on my dually, I ride diesel
Only rock Amiris with my team, not no Diesel
Got some niggas up in Philly play with birds like they Eagles
She keep sayin' I'm the man, that shit boostin' up my ego
Still in Atlanta sellin' bags like they legal, I'm just sayin' (Yeah)

[Chorus]
How you try to run off with the wave and you ain't surfin'?
Gave 'em all the drip, them niggas still acted thirsty
I ain't even counted up to see what I'm worth yet
All I know is put it up and keep on workin'
I can't even hold you, I been gettin' loaded
Devil on my shoulders
God got my back, so I keep on rollin', yeah
[Verse 2]
Drop-top McLaren (Oh), everybody starin' (Lookin')
Lil' one from the hood turned into the man (Big dawg)
Get a lot of money (Yeah), try to stuff it in my pants (4 Pockets)
I might do the woah (Woah), nigga, I don't dance
Rings on my hand cost a fortune
Shout out to my mama, no abortion (What's up?)
D-Boy, white Air Forces (Crisp)
Different kinda bags, I got choices (Flavors)
And I got the swag for a loyal ticket
Think I'm hearin' voices in my head sayin', "Kill him" (Kill him)
Know she'll forgive me, I'm one of the real ones
Really from the trenches, turn a dollar to a nickel (Get 'em)
Baddest of the baddest, guess I gotta wait to pick 'em
Try us, then we smashin', then they go to playin' victim (Kill 'em)
I don't know what happened, all I know is he got hit up
I'ma need a napkin, chains drippin', VV's lit up
I'ma get the money and go hard long as I get up (Get up)
We gon' beat the trial, I told lil' bruh to do some sit-ups (Push-up)
Win, win, win, no lose or draw, I never give up (Nah)
Nigga, what you bangin'? What you claimin'? Throw that shit up (4, Baby)

[Chorus]
How you try to run off with the wave and you ain't surfin'?
Gave 'em all the drip, them niggas still acted thirsty
I ain't even counted up to see what I'm worth yet
All I know is put it up and keep on workin'
I can't even hold you, I been gettin' loaded
Devil on my shoulders
God got my back, so I keep on rollin', yeah

(Cook that shit up, Quay)
[Verse 1]
My mama been told me don't give no poor performance
And whatever you gon' do, just do it
Never thought 'bout doin' music
I was tryna build my phone up
Contacts full of drug abusers
Ridin' around with that Mexican, tryna figure out what my cousin doin'
Prison with the 'migos, found out they was sellin' bricks
Wish I would've knew that shit, I would've been lit
Swear to God, since I was seventeen, I been hood rich
I be at James Harden house, I'm all in Houston in the mix
I'm talkin' 'bout spare time in New York, I buy floor seats to watch the Knicks
And I don't even know no players
I just wan' show off my new drip and put my chains in layers
I might just stand up and go crazy, someone make the layup
And we ain't squashin' shit for free, you niggas gotta pay us
You niggas better pay up, yeah
Know he might not beat it, I told the lawyer go for a lighter sentence
I don't want know no problems with y'all niggas, y'all got women tendencies
I don't gotta sell drugs no more, I'm bossed up, I got plenty business
Ridin' 'round in that Lam' truck, I wreck this bitch, it ain't rented
Givin' out my respect, get respect in every city
Niggas know I came up, but I came back through the slums with Diddy
Fucked around and got plugged in, I'm buyin' that red Richard Mille
Stay out my lil' brother business, just know that they gettin' millions

[Chorus]
Press the button right there to let the doors in
Go hard all year, I don't care, I'm goin' all in
This house, vibes everywhere, she callin' more friends
My word or nothin', I ain't lyin', I cannot bargain
[Verse 2]
Sippin' wockiana, come here, thotiana
Let me bust you down, ah, yeah, yeah
What kinda watch you wanted?
Man, that's nothin', mami
I'm not bein' funny, yeah, yeah, yeah
I should've knew you was gon' rat the day you told me
A hundred racks in all dubs, it ain't no foldin' me
I ain't no puppet, I ain't with nobody controllin' me
I go LeBron when it's crunch time, it ain't no holdin' me
You got the Maybach, Benz truck, I'm tryna buy one
I told lil' shawty just let bygones be bygones
Tell the feds get off my dick, I don't gotta buy guns
They got the right one, yeah
[Chorus]
Press the button right there to let the doors in
Go hard all year, I don't care, I'm goin' all in
This house, vibes everywhere, she callin' more friends
My word or nothin', I ain't lyin', I cannot bargain

To let the doors in
I'm goin' all in
She callin' more friends
I cannot bargain

Cook that shit up, Quay
4 Pockets Full, nigga
[Chorus]
Is you mad?
'Cause I'm getting cash
That ain't my place
Bought a new Wraith
She in my face
I want her head
I want her legs
I want a redhead
I want her head
I want her neck
I want her legs
You don't need the bed
We can fuck on the floor
We can fuck in the shower
Leave your friends at the door
Tell 'em give you a hour
[Verse 1]
And they know I'ma GOAT
I got paper and power
Man, these niggas some hoes
Everything they say sour
I bought a Bentley and blew out her brain
Since I got money and people done changed
I'm keepin' my .40, I'm up on my aim
Jump out of line, I bust at your brain
Shoebox money, it ain't nothin' to me
I could make a hunnid in my sleep
These niggas cappin', that's all they see
They just wanna be like me
Takin' this swag and then give it back
I didn't get mad, I went and got more
They just wanna be like him
I don't wanna be like them
Used to wanna be like him
'Til I stayed down and ran up an M
Baby ballin', they should put it on film
Shootin' for bricks, I don't aim for the rim
Fuck the gym, I don't work out
Take a sip of the lean, wash the Perc down
I got on all my jewels, foreign, and all my shoes
These niggas mad 'cause I won't lose
I gotta win, I just began
No fake love, no fake friends
Just 30 in this FN

[Chorus]
Is you mad?
'Cause I'm getting cash
That ain't my place
Bought a new Wraith
She in my face
I want her head
I want her legs
I want a redhead
I want her head
I want her neck
I want her legs
You don't need the bed
We can fuck on the floor
We can fuck in the shower
Hey, your friends at the door
Tell 'em give you an hour
[Verse 2]
I go deep in her throat
Keep that shit on the low
Don't nobody else know
That's our business fasho
We can fuck on the counter
I keep takin' these downers
Pop me a Addi, a Percocet, pour me a four
Baby, we grown, we could fuck on the floor
I'm gettin' money
That's why they mad
That ain't my fault
Nigga, I'm a boss
Get white chalked
Playin' with an OG
I got bags
These niggas owe me, they know me
Standin' in the kitchen and workin' my wrists
I made a duece, turned to a nick
I make a nick, turned to a nine
I made a nine, turned to a split
You know the rest, I made a split, turned to a brick
We in this bitch, we got it lit
We got them sticks

Is you mad?
'Cause I'm getting cash

Bought a new Wraith

Baby, huh

Christian Dior on my shoes
They cost a band, I prolly won't wear again
Lil Mizzy just came on the news
I'm thinkin', "Damn, he back in trouble again"
Made me a mil' 'cause I can
I know who I am, and I give thanks to the man
The tiger just jumped out the can
That's my lil' man, right back gettin' action again
That young nigga shit, we still on it
My dawg goin' through it, I feel for him
She told me she love me, I fell for it
Got real niggas sittin' in jail for it
Buy the pack, I'ma put it in the mail for it
On the hunt for the money, I smell for it
I went big dawg on them, this Tom Ford
That lil' boy shit I ain't goin' for it
Gettin' money every day I wake up
Don't ask me, "Did me and lil' shawty break up?"
Them M's comin' in, let 'em stack up
Don't ride my wave, dawg, back up
I ain't never had shit, I gotta act up
Don't come too close, my dawgs wan' buck
I don't need no help, I don't ask for much
If I ever go broke, we maskin' up

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Ran the money up, way up
Life ain't sweet, ain't no lay-up
Drip for sale, they gotta pay us
I stayed down and I came up
Stayed the same and they changed up
I knew they was gon' change up
Money never gon' change us
I just be in my lane stuck
[Verse 2: Gunna]
I parked the Bentley inside the garage
I don't know how much hate I can dodge
I can get you knocked off with a nod
4 Pockets Full, everyone got a knot
I say this shit from the heart
I knew you weren't real, you weren't there from the start
Anything good in my way came from God
Go get on stage and I get an applause
Damn Young Gunna done growed up
Back to back the coupes, they know it's us
My bro took a loss and I picked him up
We stick together, they ain't rich as us
I wanna sit down, she ain't lit enough
Every time I count cash, swear I get a rush
My money long as the yellow bus
It ain't no secret, I'm livin' plush

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Ran the money up, way up
Life ain't sweet, ain't no lay-up
(Cook that shit up, Quay!)
Drip for sale, they gotta pay us
I stayed down and I came up
Stayed the same and they changed up
I knew they was gon' change up
Money never gon' change us
I just be in my lane stuck
[Outro: Lil Baby]
Ran the money up, way up
Life ain't sweet, ain't no lay-up
Money never gon' change us
I just be in my lane stuck
Stayed the same and they changed up
I knew they was gon' change up

She got them ass shots that I like
Pop a Addy, we'll be fuckin' all night
She say she got a man but it's alright, shoot outta town, first class flight

(Cook that shit up, Quay)
[Verse 1]
Go to lunch in the Jewish community (Yeah)
I wouldn't tell on the bros with immunity (Nah)
Playin' victim, that shit ain't gon' ruin me
I'm the only now that outdo me
I got hoes by the group tryna do me
My life like a movie, get head in the water
Don't gotta put in no work, I send orders
This shit done got serious, them millions come plural, I'm living by morals
We swipe 'em, ain't keepin', no Dora Explorer
I'm young and I'm turnt, I got bitches galore
My baby, my whip cost two-fifty, I'm splurgin'
Got five million cash just in case of emergency
My young niggas kill, get away, they be purgin'
It happened like this, I ain't do it on purpose
I'm working my move, nigga, which one of you workin'?
I turned on my crew, bought a coupe off of verses
I'm tired of these strippers, I'm going at nurses and doctors and dentists
You started, I finished, I told you we with it
My word is like gold to my city
I tell 'em to go, they gon' get it
I heard that you froze when they hit it
Putting these hoes in the business, you know that you tripping
I tell 'em no, they gon' listen
Knowin' these niggas be sweet and some bitches, I'm different

[Chorus]
She tryna leave me, I'm low down
I hang with savages, don't bring your ho 'round
I'm going bougie, I'm switchin' my profile
All of my cars get delivered with no miles
They think they do and we don't, I don't know how
Run through the load, call the plug, I need more pounds
I put on drip every day from the floor up
I'm getting sick of this shit, pour some more up, yeah
[Verse 2]
Cullinan shot in, my driver named Solid
I keep him on point, make sure nobody follow us
I got a Glock with a shot that can stop a truck
I get the money eight ways like an octopus
No way in hell I'ma give all these choppers up
Team full of players, ain't nobody stopping us
He out of line, give a fuck, then we poppin' him
Been raisin' hell, back in school, I was popular, yeah
All of my hoes get facials, face me
Make her my bitch too much, she lazy
I was thinking prices too high, then I raised 'em
Shit in my bank account gettin' outrageous
Niggas smellin' like that, had to switch up my fragrance
And I'm sending out shots if the fouls get flagrant
Switch up my route to the house, had to change it
Still with the shit, I forget that I'm famous

[Chorus]
She tryna leave me, I'm low down
I hang with savages, don't bring your ho 'round
I'm going bougie, I'm switchin' my profile
All of my cars get delivered with no miles
They think they do and we don't, I don't know how
Run through the load, call the plug, I need more pounds
I put on drip every day from the floor up
I'm getting sick of this shit, pour some more up, yeah
She tryna leave me, I'm low down
I hang with savages, don't bring your ho 'round
I'm going bougie, I'm switchin' my profile
All of my cars get delivered with no miles
They think they do and we don't, I don't know how
Run through the load, call the plug, I need more pounds
I put on drip every day from the floor up
I'm getting sick of this shit, pour some more up, yeah
[Outro]
I'm getting sick of this shit, pour some more up
I put on drip every day from the floor up
I'm getting sick of this shit, pour some more up
I put on drip every day

[Chorus]
Slide my Rolls-Royce through the hood, that shit look good like right on

Tell the police I don't do nothin’, I been sellin' these songs
Ain't puttin’ no cap inside my rap, ain't too much leadin' you on

Everybody in a supercharger, I know we getting away
She want me to cum inside of who, I nutted in her face
I don't like to go too many places, I run shit in the A
Get a hotel for a year straight, ain't no pillow where I stay
I know bitches who set niggas up, yeah
I know niggas who whack bitches too, yeah
I been in a hundred million movies
Life is real, let her pop a pill, she enjoyed herself
Bad bitches, put 'em in the ring, they go below the belt
No referee, ain't no stoppin’ me, I’m tryna take it there
The only problems I'm havin’ in life is which watch I'ma wear
I grew up on that take it shit, I don't know how to steal
I ain't with all that fakin’ shit, I'd rather keep it real
You mad at me about a bitch who fucking both of us
I went and ran my money up, I swear it's over for 'em
I done gave my feelings up, I don't know who to trust
Shit comin' up missin' at the spot, I don't know who to bust
She my gangster bitch, I gave her racks and told her, "Stash that"
Love it when you throw it back like, damn, you know that ass fat
You know I'ma blast back, you know I'm way past that
So why you acting like it's something that it wasn't?
She know how to make me mad, I swear this bitch push every button
I know how to run up cash, I swear I'm gettin' hella money
Real spill

[Chorus]
Slide my Rolls-Royce through the hood, that shit look good like right on
Get your own salon, your hair done when you want from now on
Tell the police I don't do nothin', I been sellin' these songs
Ain't puttin' no cap inside my rap, ain't too much leadin' you on
Slide my Rolls-Royce through the hood, that shit look good like right on
Get your own salon, your hair done when you want from now on
Tell the police I don't do nothin', I been sellin' these songs
Ain't puttin' no cap inside my rap, ain't too much leadin' you on
[Verse 2]
Bae, don't put me on your camera, you know what I look like
She like, "Put it in me raw," I asked her like, "What I look like?"
Bae, just call me when you get here, you know I don't book flights
We can't pop out, it won't even look right
I just hit the woman of my dreams with another bitch
I done scratched ten million off my bucket list
I'm never on no sucker shit
My city stand behind me, that's why I love this shit
Buildin' up for my kids' kids' kids, I ain't gon' never quit
Investin' my money in all type of shit, ownership
Please don't involve me in all that messy shit, I don't want the bitch
I put twenty-sixes on my Cullinan, that country shit
Buildin' up my audience, I'm all in other countries with it
Maxin' out my debit cards in one store
Take a pretty girl and give her what she want, I'm just having fun
Catch me cuttin' up in that ZR1, it's the fast kind
I done got my shit together, I'm way better than last time, yeah

[Chorus]
Slide my Rolls-Royce through the hood, that shit look good like right on
Get your own salon, your hair done when you want from now on
Tell the police I don't do nothin', I been sellin' these songs
Ain't puttin' no cap inside my rap, ain't too much leadin' you on
Slide my Rolls-Royce through the hood, that shit look good like right on
Get your own salon, your hair done when you want from now on
Tell the police I don't do nothin', I been sellin' these songs
Ain't puttin' no cap inside my rap, ain't too much leadin' you on

I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win
I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win
[Verse 1]
You pillow talkin' to hoes again
You breakin' the code again
I'm on the road again
We snuck in this bitch with them poles again
This chopper do tricks, you gon' go fold it in
I know they be hatin', I still post they shit
We slid on they block like we 'posed to slid
This Glock been with me on my road to riches
We done over-sold the load again
Too many plays, been up for too many days
Boy, you a bitch, you got feminine ways
I get the drop, I'ma pay, they gon' spray where you stay
I had to check on my man, think he part of the Klan
Keep a mask, he got too many Ks
I had to run up them bands when I got out the can
Can't go back, I got too many cases
He actin' bad on the 'Gram, but we know what's gon' happen
It happen in every occasion
Somebody killed, I be tellin' my youngins to chill
Check the stats, I do numbers, for real
And this ain't no cap, I get money, for real
That lil' boy ain't run up no commas, for real
Don't play with Baby, I go million for million
I made it out, but yet I'm still in the field
Five hundred racks sittin' in my Urus
Ten carat diamonds spent in my earlobes
Superhero Baby, savin' the ghetto
If I'm not the man, I'm the man in the middle
Hop out the car with my hand on my pistol
He just a fan and he mad I don't feel him
I know they know that I ran with them killers
Fuck it, you know I still run with them guys
Drivebys a waste of my time, I want somebody to die
I risk it all, put my sack on the line
I came from the back of the line
We had it crackin' since back when lil' one was alive
You can go ask on my line
I wish Lil Woo would've never went through with his move
But I'm glad that he through with his dime, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win
I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win
[Verse 2]
He tryna diss me, that shit ain't gon' get to me
I can't give pussy-ass niggas my energy
He say that shit when I see him, then he'll see
Know they mad 'cause they can't take a seat with me
Got the best of the best in the sheets with me
Hands down, can't nobody compete with me
I eat filet mignon, I'm a cash cow
I got ten million cash from my last album
I'm just waitin' on bronem to max out
Every show that I get, it be packed out
5K for your teeth, you got ripped off
Spent a hundred thousand on mine
Crack a smile just to show the diamonds
From the corner to another continent
Got a baby daddy? I don't wanna hit
Need a Nike deal how I'm runnin' shit
He can't come to the A, he on punishment
Catch that boy out of place, we gon' punish him
Take his chain and his watch on some funny shit
Brodie ready to crash on some dummy shit
Gotta fuck me for free, ain't no money, bitch
I've been on some pimp shit lately
I been off a jet with some made men
We had twenty vibes out in Vegas

[Chorus]
I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win
I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win
[Outro]
I go hard as I can go to win
I go hard as I can go to win
I go hard as I can go to win
Hard as I can go to win
Hard as I can go to win

Humble
48 ContributorsHumble Lyrics“Humble” was first previewed by Baby on March 21, 2020 with a snippet posted to his Instagram and was teased along with a deluxe version of his sophomore studio album, My Turn.[Intro: Lori Perry & Lil Baby]
Day after day
Seems like I push against the clouds
(Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
They just keep blocking out the sun
It seems since I was born
I've wakened every blessed morning
I been thinkin' to myself lately
Wonderin' did she mean it when she say she hate me?
Or wonderin' did she mean it when she say she wished she didn't keep the baby? (Down on my luck and up against the wind)
[Verse 1]
Told Solid to speed it up, you ain't driving Miss Daisy
Rolls Royce truck plus, yeah, you driving Lil Baby
Hit from the back and grab her neck, it be drivin' her crazy
Ain't work no job since we met, I'm the reason she lazy
I got some checks that I ain't touch, they for Loyal and Jason
Really wanna have a daughter just so I can spoil her
Maybe look at women different
Father God, forgive me, I'ma been sinning for a minute
We bought sticks when it was tension
Fuck that bitch, she want attention
She get famous if I mention
I ain't gon' say her name at all
I was just sittin' in prison, damn near livin' like a dog
I remember that shit vividly, I do this shit for y'all
I'm not lookin' for no sympathy, won't cry about no loss
I got demons all on my back and arms, I'm tryna shake 'em off
I can't never fuck with lil' Mill again, he tried to take me off
I can't lie, you was my dawg, I heard that shit, it broke my heart
Can't no nigga say I did somethin' flawed, been solid from the start
Every situation ever happened, Baby played his part
I ain't never did shit to brag about it, I do that shit with honors
In my bag, but I been layin' back, I'm turnin' up this summer
Guess you mad 'cause I've been havin', tellin' hoes I was a runner
If I was, I was the richest runner in Georgia, on my mama
And I ain't never been no worker, had my own number, ask bruh
Seven summers straight we went crazy, called it good luck

[Chorus]
I been keepin' my distance, I switched up my number
I done made all these millions, I'm keepin' my hunger
All this food in a big house, my stomach still rumble
Got the ball, I won't fumble
I just touch down, stay humble
I been keepin' my distance, I switched up my number
I done made all these millions, I'm keepin' my hunger
All this food in a big house, my stomach still rumble
Got the ball, I won't fumble
I just touch down, stay humble, yeah
[Verse 2]
Thinkin' 'bout that shit you said, I can't get it out my head
I know that my heart is black, so all my cars' insides is red
I don't wanna argue with no one, let's get this guap instead
I ain't tryna beef with none these niggas 'cause all my opps is dead
If you ever run into police, you better not tell
Turn it up, I might as well, you know I'm so 4PF
'Fore I go, I gotta say what's up to all the bros in jail
I know that they be listenin', I know that he'll be with me
And his lawyer cost one-sixty, I hope they un-convict him when he go back
Follow him with a low jack, then step on him like a doormat
Doin' dirt, can't go back, my mind straight, ain't no slackin'
Guns all in Renee house, you ain't from the hood if you don't know Madison

[Chorus]
I been keepin' my distance, I switched up my number
I done made all these millions, I'm keepin' my hunger
All this food in a big house, my stomach still rumble
Got the ball, I won't fumble
I just touch down, stay humble
I been keepin' my distance, I switched up my number
I done made all these millions, I'm keepin' my hunger
All this food in a big house, my stomach still rumble
Got the ball, I won't fumble
I just touch down, stay humble, yeah

Money Forever
24 ContributorsTranslationsРусскийMoney Forever Lyrics[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I had to spread my wings, jump out my nest
Ran out of Act so I'm pourin' up red
I took the harder way like I'm Derez
Shout out the doctor keep givin' these meds
I got the streets in a lock like some dreads
Ride on the back of that bitch like some pegs
Runnin' this shit, they should cut off my legs
Had to play a little smarter, I'm using my head
Dropped out of school, took the street way instead
I'm a lil' dope boy, I want me some bread
I'ma shoot at your body, won't aim for your neck
I just cashed out on a flooded Patek
It ain't a big one, but dammit, it's big enough
I just came home from the can, I'ma live it up
I rep the gang, when you see me, I'ma throw it up
I just spent three hundred racks on a Bentley truck
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Screamin' out, "gang, gang, gang, gang, gang"
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane

[Verse 2: Lil Baby & Gunna]
Gotta maintain, can't go back broke
Gotta stand tall, won't bend or fold
Drop top 'Vette, tryna keep it in a Rolls
Ain't signin' no deal, ain't sellin' my soul
Gotta run it up fast, my mama gettin' old
I'm a million dollar nigga, gotta reach my goal
Got the hood on my back, still throwin' up fours
They say the Act gettin' low, I'm still pourin' up fours
I pour the six if it cost me
I like to fuck on your ho on the balcony
I got the cheese and I got me some broccoli
All color money, this shit like monopoly
Can't get this drip, ain't no need for you watchin' me
I ran my racks up and I moved out of poverty
I'm keepin' designer all over my body
I got some Buscemi, I got new Givenchy
Damn, I thought I'd never see the day
I'm so glad I made it through the rain
They don't wanna see a nigga straight
They don't wanna see young Gunna paid
Take a long time, I had to wait
Want this penthouse, a lot of space
A lot of hundreds comin' our way
Bust it down, split it with the gang

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Screamin' out, "gang, gang, gang, gang, gang"
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane
[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I used to sleep on the floor for a mattress
Getting evicted, that shit was embarrassing
My mama didn't have it, we made us a palettes
I had to share with the roaches and rats
Keep gettin' money these voices keep telling me
I went to prison, it made me a better me
I can't get no job, I got too many felonies
I been on probation since I was like seventeen
I done got me some stripes in the hood like a referee
I used to walk into school with that fire on me
I'm gettin' money, ain't really got time to beef
I don't know why these lil' bitches be lyin' on me
I'm the jungle for real where them lions be
I'm goin' apeshit, they callin' me Willie B
These niggas be sayin' they gon' rob me but we'll see
I'm gon' make every nigga with 'em fear me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Screamin' out, "gang, gang, gang, gang, gang"
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane
[Outro: Lil Baby]
Run it all up and stay the same, yeah
I'ma run it all up and stay the same
Run it all up and stay the same, yeah
I'ma run it all up and stay the same
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
Run it all up and stay the same, yeah
I'ma run it all up and stay the same

Frozen
29 ContributorsFrozen Lyrics[Intro]
Can someone come unthaw my heart? I think it's frozen
[Verse 1]
How you bring a knife to a gunfight?
They gon' always do it twice when it's done right
I remember ridin' 'round 'til the sunlight come up
I ain't tryna argue so I hung up
D-boy fresh with it on me, know how I pop out
If bullshit is not important, what I'm gon' lie 'bout?
Don't play with Baby, I give you somethin' to cry 'bout
That's a dime, that's for you and four of your friends to fly out
Every time we outside, that shit be goin' up
I got women tryna get at me like you been growin' up
Really, I know you see what's happenin', I'm steady blowin' up
I know niggas want me to fall but I'm steady goin' uphill
Started from the bottom, how the fuck I'm up here?
If you rеally came from nothin', then you know how that feel
Ain't no extras, only stеppers, that's the way that I live
Put some extras on it, blessed it, nigga, that's what I did
Heart cold frozen, got my mindset on where on however this shit go
Still kinda nervous hopin' nobody would notice it
At the point, I met you, slowed me down
You fuckin' up my focus, bro, I'm really on some more shit
Ain't been on the scene that much, I'm somewhere gettin' loaded
Ain't talkin' 'bout weed that I smoked or lean that I po'd
I'm talkin' 'bout this money I'm savin' up, I been in the tuck
Fuckin' with me, winin' the lottery, ayy, who feelin' lucky?
Know some real ones ready to slide with me if I press the button
People who done really been down from me, they don't ask for nothin'
Keepin' it one million, I'm too real to say that I'm one hundred
You are not the one 'cause you got money, real shit

[Chorus]
I don't know what they told you, but you got me fucked up
You see how we walked in? You can't see we run stuff?
I gotta think out the box, I hate bein' bunched up
Glad that I been through a lot, it made me a monster
I done seen this shit get grimy, I can't have no conscience
See 'em tryna clone me and all, but it's only one me
If I came in this world alone, why I get lonely?
Can someone come unthaw my heart? I think it's frozen
[Verse 2]
I don't feel a lot of this shit, I can't even hold you
Catch me in the Hamptons with Mike Rubin or HOV them
Or catch me in the hood with a Lamborghini with the doors up
I can't even lie, it broke my heart, I heard you told some
Gotta keep my fire under my jacket, it's a cold world
She with me when he go out to practice, this a cold girl
She a goblin, she don't even stop it, make your toes curl
Bae, I'm sorry for puttin' our business out there
You too cool for a loser, you could be winnin' out here
You keep it wet, I'm gon' invest, support yo' swimmin' line
Don't worry 'bout that, just do yo' best, I promise you'll be fine
You let that shit come out yo' mouth, now you can't press rewind, it's stuck there
Five million cash, all blues, you get a rush, yeah
I don't need a nigga or a bitch, who the fuck cares?
You the one that's really sour, I ain't even gon' go there
You was 'posed to be here, but oh well

[Chorus]
I don't know what they told you, but you got me fucked up
You see how we walked in? You can't see we run stuff?
I gotta think out the box, I hate bein' bunched up
Glad that I been through a lot, it made me a monster
I done seen this shit get grimy, I can't have no conscience
See 'em tryna clone me and all, but it's only one me
If I came in this world alone, why I get lonely?
Can someone come unthaw my heart? I think it's frozen

TouchofTrent be wildin' with it
[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Missed out on my kids' life for a year and I gotta accept it
Certain days niggas never came to my shows and I felt neglected
Growin' up, seein' my uncle dyin' in his bed, that shit made me reckless
Pourin' up and I ain't never sharin' my meds, and I ain't bein' extra
And I paid like two of my niggas bonds before I bought a necklace
I done seen my brother stack his bricks up and it look like Tetris
Havin' real shootout up on the e-way, you can't miss your exit
Told the bitch she can't hide the smеll of my cologne, she gotta go change hеr panties
Take care of your family and them kids 'cause I'm too big on family
Fuck them fast cars, before that shawty 'nem was gon' slide in Camrys
I'ma get my lawyer an extra dub because it come in handy
Felt like I'ma vomit off this Perc' 'cause I don't take no Xannies
[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Voice of the heroes
I'm the voice of the heroes
Voice of the heroes
Voice of the heroes
See, I'm the voice, Baby, he the hero
Baby, he the hero
I'm the voice, but Baby, he the hero
But Baby, he the hero

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I wasn't even tryna be no idol
I put niggas on, and all of a sudden they feel entitled
Put the Brabus on it, you only get this kit when you got a title
I'm exhausted, I been workin' shift-to-shift, but I keep fightin'
Not my fault if I don't miss your likeness
And I'm still with Ced still
We the ones, for real, for real
I just got two hundred for a walk through, I'll still drill
High-speed chases in a Dodge Stratus, I can still peel 'em
I be tryna put on a smile for 'em but I don't really feel 'em
I just spent three-fifty on a Richard for the second time
I showed all my niggas in the trenches it's a better life
Never get too big for me to listen, I'll take your advice
I just told Durk, "We rich forever if we play it right"
Just keep on bein' the voice, I'll be the hero
And everything I got is a profit, started with zero
I can never turn my back on my apartment, that's where I come from
And I'm just gettin' started, relax, wait 'til I warm up
[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I done been to jail too many times, it feel like karma
Everywhere I sleep, I keep my stick, what I need an alarm for?
Police caught me in the cut, I had to walk out with my arms up
Ain't too big to pray last minute, I put my palms up
Yeah, flood my system with these Percies
Took the bitch to eat out at Thirteen, she was squirtin'
I just cashed out on my bitch, Celine to match her Birkin
All this shit these bitches textin' me, just do it in person

[Verse 4: Lil Baby]
Yeah, I might pop a half an Adderall, I don't like Percies
Put the phone on DND, I'm somewhere in her cervix
I just slimed a nigga out today but it was worth it

Four stones in the ear, D's at the bottom
GA certified before I was GIA certified
Mr. M-In-Cash anytime you see me, you know?
Only a few rappers play a duck to catch a duck, you know?
Trickin’ niggas who trickin' niggas, you know?
Supercar-drivin', Gulf Stream-flyin’, designer-wearin' golden child, you know?
Wham (Wheezy outta here)
Let's go
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Hoppin' off a plane to a Matchbox
Hundred times platinum, fuck a plaque
Bulletproof the tires, run flat (I'm goin')
Cutthroat, I give her one chance (Go 'head)
Slut her out and gave her one band (No problem)
Twenty-five cars, one man (I pop 'em)
Driveway like a mini dealership (Come park it)
He went sour, cut the business with him (You bold)
Crack smoker, I was livin’ with ’em (Auntie 'nem)
Weird hoes, I ain’t dealin' with 'em (Can't see me)
Overseas, they love a real nigga (European)
She don’t like it, but she deal with it (She stingy)
'Raris back-to-back, that's tough (Two million)
Hear us 'round the corner, that's us (Skrrt)
Puttin' on stuff, best dressed (Night time)
Flip phone, black Nike Tech (My kind)
We done done it all, what's next? (Too picky)
Boss Man, name on the checks (Big business)
First one's come through trim (Literally)
Dipset, Jim Jones baller (Big bucker)
Life of a fuckin' hustlerholic (I'm hustlin')
She know not to text me, I'ma call her (Hush)
Bro in prison, livin' through a pack (And)
Farewell, I don't see a scratch (Look close)
She ain't mine if she don't got me tatted (No way)
OCD, need everything intact (Clean up)
Bitches tryna play me like I'm wack (Bitch, who?)
Real P, I bet' not go for that
Ridin' through the trey in all black
Pullin' up on Pluto in the 6 (Bird gang)
Hood full of dope-slanging tricksters (My neighbors)
I come from that 4, I'm a real one (I came up)

[Interlude: Young Thug]
Yeah, nigga, King Spider back
I don't even believe I was locked up, for real, for real
I was havin' my way the whole time, fool, you know what I'm sayin'? (Yeah)
[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Two Lamb' coupes, four Lamb' trucks
Pullin' up, what the fuck? (What the fuck?)
Neck, wrist, fingers slush (Eee)
Order hundred G's, that's us (Hee)
New Rolls Cullinan truck (Skrrt)
Dog on the side like a bus (Yeah)
Shawty mad, ain't goin' back and forth (Uh)
Never heard a rich nigga fuss (No)
Heard these niggas going out sad
'Rari truck came with a bag
Only fuckin' overseas shit
These U.S. bitches kinda bad
College bitch, I made her leave a frat
Fucked my brother, gave the bitch a pass
Trappin' in the studio, I'm glad
Break a bale, the junkie get the trash (Hee)
I was taught to pay a bitch to leave (Yeah)
I go Birk', Chanel for the fleece (Birks)
Four 'em at a time like a sheikh (Four)
I been on a boat, screamin', "Ski" (Ski)
Saint Laurent, they bring it to the beach (Beach)
She was Portuguese and Middle East (Woo)
She snorted off the ki' (Snotty)
Got her screamin' RIP to Keed (RIP to Keed)
Niggas can't stand us (Uh-huh)
Doggy, put your mans up (Okay)
Walked her down in Lanvins (Yeah)
Pocket full of grandparents (Okay)
Old school, the Trans Am one (Skrrt)
Cullinan, the ambulance one (Skrrt)
You good, your mans can't come (Yeah)
I don't give a fuck 'bout nothin'

[Interlude: Future]
Yeah
Brr, brr, ski
Ayy, say gang
[Verse 3: Future]
Pour it on thick like syrup
Elevator pad at the crib
Shopping bags all on the floor
Never seen me twice with a ho
Backyard vibes by the ocean
Driveway look like a car show
Three hundred-fifty million, I'm the G.O.A.T. 
Custom leather Pucci on the door
Fifty birds of dog on my wrist
Cocaine jumpin' off my bitch
Thirty-two shots with the glitch
Talkin' Vicks, then we talkin' Chris
Micro mini with a beam
Puttin' the side hoes in Celine
Geekin' off the millions like a bean
Push a button and make your mama grieve
Eat it up, she workin' for a boss
Out the country, livin' like a boss
Princess-cut and showin' all the flaws
Graduated, cookin' up the raw
Pushin' skateboard, Tony Hawk
Crankin' up the car when I talk
Alligator, Hermès stuff
Dropped eight dollars on a truck
Codeine bottles, they for us
Put them legal sticks on the bus
Off tour, straight to the pit
Three bad bitches gettin' hit
Solitaires made they eyes squint
Smell the dirty money through the vents
House full of dead presidents

[Outro: Lil Baby, Young Thug & Future]
Wham
Spider
Ayy, say gang

Catch the Sun
33 ContributorsCatch the Sun Lyrics[Intro]
(Hit-Boy)
[Verse 1]
Seems like we runnin' outta time
Yeah, we still so young and got so much to find
We can't never let 'em break our mind
We gotta stay strong, conquer and don't divide
I come in peace, my heart already set on fire
If it ain't color, what's the difference from you and I?
I'll let you decide or come up with some repeated lies
I'm just tired of my kind gotta be the one to die
Lookin' in the sky, I know you with me, I can't cry
Standin' what I stand on, I can't never switch sides
Sometimes I just wanna pop out on 'em and flip by
But I put my head on, I pray, I stay from off the route
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas, I ain't seen 'em in a while
Thinkin' 'bout my son, I just had another child
I been thinkin' back on bro, like, "What the fuck we gon' do now?"
On this road to redemption, this shit get rocky and it's wild
Let me tell you 'bout it
[Chorus]
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest

[Verse 2]
Know you be behind me if it ever came to this
But I never would've thought that we'll have to take this risk
Or ever be in this position, just keep ridin', don't go missing
If we in this together, this the way it 'posed to feel
I'm going out with a bang, I'm tellin' you what it is
If I get racial profiled where I live
'Cause my crib bigger than theirs, or my cars up to date
Or it's probably be my girl shape, they probably wanna date her
Or they heard I got my cake up, middle finger to them haters
My life finally matters, I got up and I'ma stay up
I know it lookin' like a dream, but it ain't everything it seem
Ain't no tellin' where I be if I ain't have God or ain't have my team
Can't let 'em trick me out the streets, I got a mind of my own
I left the house at sixteen, I told my Mama, "I'm grown"
Been through a lot of situations, I can handle my own
If I had only one call, I know you pick up the phone
If they ain't with us, we gone
[Chorus]
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest

We global now
[Chorus]
Bought her baby Gucci strollers (Strollers)
Switch it up and I went global (Global)
Can't play around, I had to grow up (Grow up)
Check out my neck, hell of a glo-up (Glo-up)
These niggas cap and that shit blow up
My dawg rappin', hope he blow up
I need my checks without no hold-ups
I put my city on my shoulders
I told the truth in every story that I told 'em
I fucked around and showed 'em
[Verse 1]
All of my whips got that new car smell
Don't get it twisted, from the 'partments, I just park well
I don't fuck with him, that nigga flawed, send him to voicemail
Catch up with him, push up on him, tell him how we all feel
Made myself a millionaire, only took a year, dawg
Thinkin' bout what I been through, I can make a tear fall
Late night with them youngins, we was creepin', could've killed y'all
We ain't gon' do that internet beefin', that's for bitches, dawg
I went up to space so they hatin', they can't lift off
I can make your bitch eat my kids, every drip drop
I come from trenches, we can't come outside in flip flops
I done came so far, sittin' on the floor, watchin' the tip-off

[Chorus]
Bought her baby Gucci strollers (Strollers)
Switch it up and I went global (Global)
Can't play around, I had to grow up (Grow up)
Check out my neck, hell of a glo-up (Glo-up)
These niggas cap and that shit blow up
My dawg rappin', hope he blow up
I need my checks without no hold-ups
I put my city on my shoulders
I told the truth in every story that I told 'em
I fucked around and showed 'em
[Verse 2]
I put my all into this shit
I worked so hard to get my wrist
It broke my heart but I didn't quit
I had to ball with no assist
I got 'em all on my drip
Go with his move, he gon' get flipped (Yeah)
I had to hustle for a meal, yeah
And now I'm hustling in these M's, yeah
Gave Jock and Dee 200 years
Whenever they call, I let 'em hear
Them lawyers I got gon' lift they spirit
Them niggas know I keep it real, yeah
Sometimes I feel like the floor is giving in on me
I work so hard but I can't stop 'cause they depend on me
I tried to holler, she didn't talk, but now her friend want me
I see through all, and my life flawed, need no lens on us

[Chorus]
Bought her baby Gucci strollers (Strollers)
Switch it up and I went global (Global)
Can't play around, I had to grow up (Grow up)
Check out my neck, hell of a glo-up (Glo-up)
These niggas cap and that shit blow up
My dawg rappin', hope he blow up
I need my checks without no hold-ups
I put my city on my shoulders
I told the truth in every story that I told 'em

(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)
(Section 8 just straight cooked that motherfucker up)
Yeah
So we was at a gas station today, I told the bros, like
Last one home owe a dub, know what I'm sayin'?
And we all ridin' in foreigns, so
That shit super fun cuttin' all through traffic, sayin'
Kinda felt like I made it for a change
That's what I do
[Verse 1]
Lamborghini truck, big Dre in the cut
Bruh them Bentley-ed up behind me, know what's in my cup
Doin' ninety in a thirty-five like I don't give a fuck (I'm sorry)
Aventador, I let lil' Q 'dem drive, make sure y'all don't hit nobody
I can't lie, this rap shit got us livin' like we hit the lottery
Crippin', knockin' niggas out, one punch like he got into boxing
I been flying state to state for drip, I done got into shopping
Every other day, it's somethin' fake, I'm duckin' paparazzi
He ain't listen, they tapped his nugget
Label told me ain't got no budget
This ain't that, and that ain't 'bout nothing
I got rich, but got folks still strugglin'
I got bros give a fuck 'bout nothin'
I got hoes, don't give a fuck 'bout fuckin'
I ain't did that if she ain't got no butt
Money bring problems, okay, so what?
Pee them too real, they bought me a Rolls truck
Sent it back to get a newer version
Cullinan with the stars in it, got the captain seats in the back
I want the white paint with the red guts, all my other cars need to match it
They be like, "Ooh, ooh," off in traffic
Gotta put racin' gas in my track kit

[Chorus]
Get money (Get money), get money (Get money)
Get money (Get money), get money (Get money)
I'm getting money (Money)
I'm getting money (Money)

[Verse 2]
How you make a whole chorus about getting money? 'Cause all I do is get money
Monday through Sunday, Sunday through Money
It ain't no stoppin', always gon' clock in
Ask for my bookin' phone like I'm trappin'
He a good rapper, yeah, but he cappin'
I treat my shows like I'm getting loads
I gotta get off anywhere I go, yeah
Hop out alone, I'm in my zone
Most of this shit I done did on my own
Niggas want credit for shit that my mama did
I really treat Lil DT like my mama kid
Been poppin' shit since I bought me that Bonneville
I'm in Atlanta from Bankhead to Summerhill
I can't play 'round 'cause I know it's kill
And I know it's real, yeah

[Chorus]
Get money (Get money), get money (Get money)

She tryna fuck me when I'm fastin', she can't come around no more
Walked in the house, my pants unfasten, then she swallows, what a ho
But it's you who I want (But it's you who I want)
But it's you who I want (But it's you who I want)
I can't split rent with my lil' bitch, that's some shit you would do to a ho

But it's you who I want (But it's you who I want)

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I'll make a scene for you
When you sleeping with me, then your dreams come true
Ain't no limitations to things we do
We just kickin', and now shе'll be lovin' me soon
I be straight to thе point, ain't no cut on a movie
Fuckin' her good all over the room
Make her nut, she'll lay there, she don't even move
I gotta go, but I'm coming back soon
Don't tell our business, you know that's the rules
It feel good to tell someone to Google you
I tell 'em, "Chill," 'cause I know what they'll do to you
I run Atlanta, get paid like I'm Julio
We made a way from the streets to the studio
Anyone feelin' me, that's who I do it for
You can't just pop out and say you the hero
You gotta put on a cape and save the day
Shawty my type, she ain't got no stomach
Look her dead in the face when I'm cummin'
Send a video, and tell me she want it
Just the other day, I gave her some money
Plead the fifth, I ain't making no comment
If it happened to them niggas, we done it
Too much shit to step for, I can't be runnin'
Boy, don't make me fly your bitch out the country

No matter what, you just be real with me
A lot of shit come with a nigga like me
I just hope that you learn how to deal with me
I only be out with a couple of niggas
Now shit bound to happen whenever we deep
I run with some hitters, they run from a camera
And they won't even take a picture with me
The teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grow up, I stood up and told her "Big Meech"
My mama ain't have much, and I wasn't good at no sports, so you know, I had fell to the streets
And I ain't no Chef Boyardee, but I get me a lil' bit of food, I'ma make sure we eat
And that shit be crazy how we used to swap our spit with each other, we don't even speak
Come with me, we'll be gone for months

Drop a bag on her, she get excited
Tryna steal her heart, I'm on a heist

One thing she know, we in this shit for life

All you ever wanted was someone
To care for your—
[Verse 1]
Yeah, made it out the trenches, this type of life I can't get used to
Number one on YouTube, private dinner in Malibu
Show you how to work your stick
Ain't nobody gon' handle you
Put you in a Phantom 'cause you my lil' boo
Ready for whatever, I tie up my boots
Everybody goin' the same route, so, I switched up my route
Niggas ain't be what they talkin' 'bout, so I switched up my crew
Actin' like you love me knowin' it's flawed, so, I'm gon' fake it too
What else am I supposed to do?
Aware of my surroundings, I don't fuck with y'all, don't come around me
"Baby switched up," how that sound? Like a nigga in his feelings
You can't name somethin' I did flawed, I'm a dyin' breed of the realest
I ain't never worry about another nigga, so in that case, I'm the biggest (Nigga)
I been travelin' around the world, my pivot's still ain't left the business
She got everything I want, ain't no need to fuck with these bitches
You can go and have a lil' fun, I ain't gon' trip, baby, I get it
Ain't bullshit in this game, wherever this plane land, I'm the littest nigga there
Turn your back on me, I ain't even care
If you need me, I'm still gon' be there
Tell me, how the fuck is this shit fair?
Switch on who? I went there
Fuck them too, I'm prepared
I run shit, get that clear
Heart broke, can't drop no tears
Was what it was, is what it is

[Chorus]
California breeze, take her out to eat
Stop at a lil' party
End up at the big house
I can't fuck with shawty 'cause she got a big mouth
Pull up in a 'Rari, hop out like a big dawg
Get my shit together, feel like I done took two years off
Bookin' on my schedule, I ain't rich enough to chill out
I watched you turn sour, I still don't know how to feel 'bout it
Majority of 'em folded, but I'm still solid
[Verse 2]
I'm still out here, still don't know how to feel about it
Early in the mornin' talkin' to Marquis about it
Wonderin', "Should I let it go, or, we beefin' 'bout it?"
Knowin' that I'll go cold on you for weeks about it
And it weren't even that deep, but, that's just how it be with me
I can't lie, she be fuckin' me good, but, girl, you fuck me better
I'm not surprised that you stereotypin' to be a lil' guy
But, if I can have a second of yo' time, try to elevate yo' mind
We can crush 'em on every level, I'm tellin' you
I fell in love with generatin' revenue
I know they gon' try to push you from the top, so I'm careful
I put niggas under my wing like they my nephew
I'ma give you every piece of game I got when I catch you
I'm just tryna let you feel the breeze with me (Yeah)

No, no, no, no
I'm supposed to be gone
But, shit, where I'm gon' go?
Tryna hold it in, I can't let this shit show
It can't be forced, it don't work, let it go
I tried to tell you, you act like you know

My bed Tempur-Pedic, I fuckin' get paid
My flow a disease, kill these rappers like AIDS
Yves St. Laurent on the lens of my shades
Gunna back up, I was goin' through a phase

You learned how to drip from you watchin' my page
Niggas be tossin', somebody decay
Off-White'd the coupe and the inside is beige

My bitch the baddest, she ain't bougie, she ratchet
I get him flipped, then I buy him a casket
I'm servin' real, I ain't just singin', rappin'
I got on Soldier Re's, they're classics
I got a 31 doin' gymnastics

Sixty five hundred was spent on this coat
(Got a bitch in the condo, she snortin' the coke)
I don't wanna fuck her just want the throat
I'm savin' my money, I ain't goin' broke
Don't want no handouts, that shit ain't no joke
They listen up when I speak, I'm the pope
I'm bringin' cash, ain't payin' no notes
I got the stick just in case they want smoke

And a surfboard 'cause we're really wavy (Surfboard)

Bitch probably mad I ain't dello
La-la-la, I am not Carmelo
Word to the opps, they gon' drop, better lay low
Haha, nah, I'm just playin', they can come out
Runnin' up the money, I ain't never tryna run out, yeah
Police get behind me, I'ma burn out (Smash)
How you get it 'fore it even come out? (Cash)
How you make a milli' in a drought? (Bag)
Traphouse geeked up fast
My mama don't like it, she ain't got no swag
I don't stay with my mama, I been in my bag
Yeah, I got it, nigga, fuck what I had, yeah
Y'all niggas need to give me my swag back
Go against me, get hashtagged
Ain't standin' that, nigga, I'm past that
How your jacket Dior and your pants match?
Road runnin', bringin' these bands back
You can take it how you want it, I'm sayin' facts
They done crunked me up, I was layin' back
I'm the wave, nigga, give me my sand back
Hopped out on 'em with a chopstick
They done killed that boy with a hand strap
You straight, I ain't givin' your mans dap

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Moneybagg Yo]
Uh-oh, the game in trouble
Started off small, now they payin' me double
Yeah, you can drip check, baby, like Mustard, yeah
Uh-oh, you better not trust 'em
Rotate 'em, all these hoes on shuffle
Money team, got a whole M in a duffle
Bitch got the nerve to say she don't like rubbers
She don't know that I know she be fuckin' my brother
Bitch, I ain't goin' out like no sucker, yeah
West Coast, smokin' on Gushers, yeah
Cartier watch, shit busted, yeah
I done ran up a whole lot, yeah
I don't want the twat, just top, yeah
Goin' up a whole 'nother notch, yeah
Can't be stuck in one slot, yeah
[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
I'm goin' up a whole 'nother notch
Lil' bruh just put a nigga on Fox, damn
A rock fell out of my watch
I ain't get mad, I just switched out clocks (Hahaha)
Treat a bad bitch like a thot (What you do?)
Burn her head pullin' off the lot
Water on water, rockin' ice on the yacht
Bought a traphouse and it came with a pot (Ugh, ugh)
The game in trouble like some badass childrens
Did they just really give me 80K for thirty minutes? Yup
And can't nobody tell me how to spend it, bitch
Send it to the hood, let 'em flip it (In the trenches)
She want me to love on her, no way
Ain't José, I don't do what the hoes say (Nope)
HD, Blu-Ray, clear shit (What that mean?)
Diamonds on me look 4K (Ugh)
Married to the money for better or worse
But nah I ain't walked down no aisle (Caked up)
That lil' nigga fucked up
He'll walk a nigga down with a Kool-Aid smile
Yesterday spent 40K on a necklace
I'm flexin', look close and you'll see your reflection
She a lil' gangster, I like her complexion
She get so wetty, then bust like confetti
If I don't do nothing, that money, I get it

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Moneybagg Yo]
Uh-oh, the game in trouble
Started off small, now they payin' me double
Yeah, you can drip check, baby, like Mustard, yeah

(Danny)
Why the fuck they put my business on the blogs?
Sisters know they never gotta get a job
Brodie said he rather spin shit and rob
Damn dawg, he ain't playing dawg
That's your plan dawg?
This your man dawg, fuck both of them, I want 'em all gone
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Shit been get shaky, I'm staying where I'm safe at
Couple spots, I don't know where I stay at
Why would you play and you know we don't play that?
Flipping words when you know I ain't say that
I been good, so I'm guessing it's pay back
Smoking woods in the back of the Maybach
I'm the hero, so they gotta face that
Hit Dior, where the fuck is my cape at?
I'm on a other one, bought another car, then another one
Bank account likе I just won a settlement
Sippin Wock', I'm addictеd to medicine
Pockets on elephant, large
I get two pretty women to come kick it with me at the penthouse, we'll have a ménage
I'll go in any nigga city, bunch of killers with me, everybody got a rod
Swear I'll nod off 'fore I fall off, this that drank talk, oh yeah
Fifteen foreign cars when I pop out, I run ATL
When I get older, I might have back problems, these Cuban links big as hell
I done fucked M's up with these lawyers tryna get my niggas outta jail
Five hundred racks for a bond, do whatever for brodie, we came up from cars that was stolen
Before it drop, I'ma have it, on top of this fashion, I'm staying in touch with the owners
You stab me right in my back when you could've just asked me what happened, when you be disloyal
We sharing all of this shit, from the money, to cars, to the hoes, it don't matter the order
One of my niggas got out and another went in, swear I'm getting sick and tired of that order
I see you drowning, I'm coming to help you, I'm risking it all, I'ma die in that water
I'm rich as fuck, I can do what I wanna
Came over sober, she left here a stoner
She know she fell asleep inside the condo, but I fuck her like I'm fresh up off the corner

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I can't change, I'm stuck in my ways
Poppin' half a half, I'm up for a day
Oh you getting money now? Okay
Tell him don't play with you, okay
I'm proud of you, you supposed to be proud of me too
I do everything that I can do
Make it happen, don't make an excuse
I sure improved
I'm the one and not the two, yeah
Lot of money on you now, yeah
Shit together, gotta count, yeah
Glad you took a different route, yeah
Tryna buy your folks a house, yeah
Glad you really made it out, yeah
You can't sit and wait around, yeah
Gotta get up and get out, yeah
You gotta get this shit now, yeah
[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I got a Cullinan 'cause I just wanted one
I run up a check and look out for my brother son
I asked DeDe Trig and that nigga was stuttering
I knew him for years and he don't know my government
You can't come around if you keep on recording me
I'm trappin', you trappin', that shit be a tournament
Voice of the trenches, nah, I couldn't be a journalist
I pour up a cup with the niggas who murder
But I ain't gon' hold you, nigga had told what I told
Niggas be using emotions, saying I'm bogus
I was just down on my back, I couldn't send cash, I wrote you
My brother did ten, got out of jail, I'm glow
I take care of my block, I'm 'posed to
I'm done fucking hoes who local
Pop me a ten, I ain't feel it
I gotta go boot up another dose
Ask, can I leave them streets alone?
Bro went to jail, and I got him a phone
Just 'cause he think 'cause he lost his motion
My brother think he ain't coming home
Fentanyl and felonies getting you gone
I switch on a nickel, I feel like a stone
The niggas who died, I never respond
I'm slapping the bitches who don't listen to Von

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I can't change, I'm stuck in my ways
Poppin' half a half, I'm up for a day
Oh you getting money now? Okay
Tell him don't play with you, okay
I'm proud of you, you supposed to be proud of me too

Back of the Phantom to get me some head
Ain't got no purple? Then get me some red (Yeah, woo)
(Yo, Nick Papz, make it slap)
[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Nigga know I back out every time the pack out, big boy straighten up offenders
I was in the trap house, chillin' with the Mac out, gang gang, me and my members (Gang gang)
Nigga, we ain't totin' no sticks 'round here, just glicks 'round here with extenders (Big boy)
Nigga, don't take no pics 'round here, everybody on parole, shit censored
I got the check, fell in love with it
I got the neck, for the hell of it
Money, respect, get a Cullinan
Come to the lil' block like an elephant
I got the lil' Glock with a drum in it
We the ones, they the ones cracking
Now forty-five-hundred my jacket, they say I'm too rich to be strapping, yeah, ooh
Suicide doors on the Phantom, it look like you gettin' in backwards
Double platinum, that's a double murder when we slide, I just put a hit on a rapper
Sneak dissin', 'fore you know it, you talkin' to God, and he tell you, "Get in the casket" (Nigga, get over there)
Stack the M's and spin all the odds, we takin' this shit to the maximum, yeah
[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Must be out of your mind, you think we ain't spinnin' for bro? (Gang) We spinnin' for sure
Had a switch on me, not a .38, dummy, boy, we be spinnin' for ghosts (Gang)
They put up for shows, we spinnin' the cribs and traps for sure, we spinnin' his shows
And we took L's for sure, but in Chicago, they know we winnin' for sure
You do it for what? You better not say that you do it for D- (Boom), them niggas be tucked
That nigga was fucked, the moment he ran and he knew he ain't duckin', his ass out of luck
We do it for Von, we don't wait 'til it die down, we load and we do it tomorrow
We do it on feet, ask all the opps about us, and who say we shoot out the cars
That Rolls better be bulletproof, lil' nigga, you know we gon' shoot at them stars
Them lil' bitches ours, I told him to fuck her and slut her and send her right back to the blogs
Glock with a switch, two of those, and I ride through the city (We ride)
And we thought a nigga died, but he didn't (But he died)
Two Glocks when you ride through Philly (Let's get it)
Tinted up if you dyin' in Philly
(You know we slide to Philly)
(Tinted up if you dyin' in Philly)
(Tinted up if you dyin' in Philly)

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
(Yeah, Baby)
Anything close to a dub, and a youngin'll walk for a hundred, he damn near get caught
Long as I send him the items, consider it bought
I call the shots, I'm the boss
I'm ridin' with the semi
Two of them, I can't die in my city
Do a shooting, it ain't gotta be pretty
Catch him out, and we handle the business
I ain't gettin' in no nigga business
Thirty million, my mind in the trenches still
Fuck her good, make her nigga not turn her on
They got brodie on camera, he comin' home
Run it up from a scale to a microphone
Treat Dior like a muhfuckin' Nike store
And you know he ain't that, why you hype him up?
Any time we have smoke, it's just pipe me up
Never know the outcome 'til you try your luck
Get whatever you want when I'm tryna fuck
And we tellin' nobody, can't fuck with us
Put the four in the P with the fuckin' F
I should never bring the pain on my fuckin' self
Really need it if I ever ask for help
I just know I'ma blow if it's life or death
I made all them hoes drink, never left
I'm way higher, I'm up in my altitude
I was broke, I woke up with an attitude
Now you play with the kid, he embarrass you
I jump right in the field with no parachute and one pair of shoes

Deep End

Cook that shit up, Quay
I know they ain't feelin' my pain
I got codeine inside my veins, yeah
[Chorus]
I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill
We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense
He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in
Lil homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end
[Verse 1]
They offerin' the shooter the death penalty, won't tell on me
I know if I go broke today, them same hoes gon' bail on me
I got them throwin' salt, they steady tryna fuck up my recipe
Amiri jeans, a hundred a pair, ain't nothin' about a nigga cheap
Sellin' weed in the projects, relapsed on the Hi-Tech
Told the gang that we up next, put 'em on a G5 jet
Overseas with my sidepiece, my queen, she gotta be a dimepiece
We gon' stick together like assigned seats, on that Dej Loaf, nigga, try me
Whoever thought I'd put a hundred on my neck?
Whoever thought that I'd say I'm the one up next?
Whoever thought they'd ever consider me the best?
Whoever thought, whoever thought, whoever thought?
[Chorus]
I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill
We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense
He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in
Lil homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end

[Verse 2]
Go and ask about me in the streets, they heard of me
If she find out I been creepin', she gon' murder me
I ain't trippin', no complaints, I got my currency up
Out of town, I let the windows down so they can see us
I take the hitters around the globe, that's all I know (That's all I know)
I met her last night she tried to give me her soul (Give me her soul)
I got 'em hatin', they throwin' shots, they on their toes
One thing they know (One thing they know)
One thing they know (One thing they know)
Ain't gon let up on them niggas, once you try us, ain't gon' stop
If it's pressure, let me know, so we can pull up with them Glocks
Tryna dodge the bullshit and tryna make it to the top
If I never sell a record I'ma make it on the block
How you gon wait 'til I make it then try to help me? Nigga I don't need you (No help)
I put the food on the table, nigga was hungry, I tried to feed you
Treat all my niggas like bosses, nobody better, everyone equal (Yeah)
Real talk this the sequel, hold it down for my people
[Chorus]
I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill
We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense
He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in

Caught a few cases, I been on the road but overall a nigga still free
I done been robbed I know how it feel, a nigga gon' have to come kill me
I been through it all, I came this far how a nigga not gon' feel me
Ain't no facade, no cap in my raps everything that I say is the real me
I give all my problems to God
Let him handle all my enemies

I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get ahead of me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get the best of me
[Verse 1]
Remember that shoot out we had that time we thought a kid died
Only thing I know is when we pulled up, everybody hopped out firin'
I remember on the way back, everybody in the car quiet
I'm just knowing everybody thinkin' we just pulled a homicide, homicide
See me on the news at the spot
Tryna see who they say got shot
I'm the first one stood up, told my brothers y'all all I got
Know if somebody seen us they gon' talk
Phone ringin' I thought it was a thottie
Thinkin' damn, "we just caught a body"
Hopin' everybody keep it solid
Fuck the nigga, I'm thinkin' bout the kid
The nigga shouldn't did what he did
I'm just glad a nigga still here for all the stupid shit that we did
Gotta be here for my kid, gotta watch my son get big
Everything I say is no lie, I'm just glad the kid didn't die

I never post no gun, but when it's smoke I bet I send a blitz
That bullshit that you on you thinkin' cool get you a 100 years
I bet yo partner fuck yo bitch, I bet you don't hear nothin' from the clique
I ain't gon' tell you no lie, this shit'll make a grown man cry
Folks give yo ass that time, you'll never see the outside
All you do is think and wonder why
Kiss the good life goodbye
Now you gotta fight to survive, ain't no guns all you got is knives
Hear a nigga sharpen 'em at night
Young niggas gone on the ice
Grown men fucking grown men they'll never tell you that part
Buy a phone you gotta have a spot
Everyday a nigga get knocked
Search team turn to the narcs, man this shit can really get hard

Caught a few cases, I been on the road but overall a nigga still free

I told her to fly and she scared of the virus, I sent her a private to get here
I made four hundred dollars off of each of these pounds, I ain't trippin', it's gon' be a good year
Solomon drivin' while I got my hands on the chopper, I'm keepin' my eyes in the rearview
I'm from Atlanta where they pay to triple cross niggas, they'll dap you up, then they'll kill you
These niggas fake and I'm real, I don't feel 'em
My niggas takers, ain't worried 'bout 'em stealing
I run with apes and some baby gorillas
I know a few (Shh), I can buy me a nigga
Said I wouldn't change but my change a lil' bigger
Four-carat ring leave a scar if I hit you
Look like a spaceship, got stars in my vehicle
These niggas fake and I don't wanna deal with 'em all
[Chorus]
I'm social distancing
Man, these niggas can't touch me, I can't get sick
Good excuse for me to pour up medicine (Syrup)
She say I ain't got no heart and I'm devil-sent
I'm on some savage shit, ah
I got the drop on the opps, switched the cars
I got a hundred inside of a drum
We pull up clapping, a round of applause
We just gon' say that they won the award

[Verse 2]
Slide in the daytime, then come back at night
We gon' make sure that nobody play with us
They make me mad, I'ma turn up
Let's talk about money, I swear I been savin' up
I'm really sick with this shit, got 'em throwin' up
He hit a lick for a brick, now he goin' up
My niggas rapping, you see us, we blowin' up
Hit the bitch for a rack, then ignore her
I'm so sick of these rats and these whores
I might marry my girl and just go away
Eat her out if she rich, got expensive taste
We ain't got rush, told the pilot to fuckin' wait
Ain't no way I can go on no fuckin' date
I don't know her and she don't know me
My lil' boy 'dem turnt up at a young age
You can say that it run in my genes

I know how it feels to stay down and run you some bands up
Hundred grand on me, it's hard holdin' my pants up
TRX, the Hellcat motor inside a RAM truck
Real ones like me hard to come by, it's only a handful
Ain't no money in the world that make me give my mans up
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I know how it feel to think everybody against you
I know how it feel to watch bullets go through a windshield
I know how it feel when you try your best to be real
I know how it feel when you think no one understands you
I know how it feel when the one you love gettin' ran through
I know how it feel, I done really cut off my mans too
I know how it feel when you broke, and them bills past due
Oh, you thought this shit was a joke? We on your ass too

I can't give my energy to anybody
I'm a billionaire in the making, I promise I'ma get one
Lil' bitch tried to chase me, I had to stiff-arm her
Only had a couple dollars, I was still gettin' fresh
I ain't tryna say I'm cocky, but I feel I'm the best
Every time, I want the maximum, ain't takin' nothin' less
I've been back-to-back jets, but I still fly Delta
Thick lil' shit, but she can fit in my schedule
Yeah, always on the go, but I make time for that ass
Know I got a lot, but I'm on the grind, tryna get mad rich
I know I be calm, but I'm nowhere near average
A hundred million dollars cold cash gettin' buried
Lookin' at the man I'm becomin', it's gettin' scary
All these bitches fuckin' whoever, who gettin' married?
I ain't tryna go back to nothin', I'm tryna have shit
I be quick to pick up that blicky, I got a bad wrist

[Verse 2]
Forgi's on your whip, I'ma tryna slide on

Baby, I be busy, I be tied up
You ain't gotta love me, just don't lie though
We gon' take them trips 'cause ain't nobody else as fly as us
Baby, we gon' let 'em have it
We go where they can't go
Pimpin', where'd my cane go?
I'm the same lil' nigga, I ain't changed though
They get salty when I pulled up in that Range Rover
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Baby, why you trippin'? I be right here for you

Anything you needin', I provide that for you

Never put none 'em before you
Baby, you my world and I swear I adore you
And I swear I adore you

[Verse 3]
Late nights, call on the phone
You say where I'm at, I'm on the way
Two hours later you be callin'
Thought you told me you was on the way
Tell you I got caught up, I got busy
But I had another bitch with me
Still when I get it there, you gon' get it
Soon as I pull up, she gon' get it
[Outro]
I ain't got no time for these bitches 'cause I'm on my grind
Baby, are you trippin'? I been on my grind (I'm grindin')
4PF, you dig?

Belly
57 ContributorsBelly Lyrics[Intro: Gunna]
Ah-ah-ah, hey
Run that back, Turbo
[Chorus: Gunna]
You niggas bogus, I see the imposers
I used to sell yola, trap on Motorolla
Spittin' these vocals, labels think I wrote it
Slippery wet paints, the coupes are candy-coated
Just left the bank, I need a bag to hold this
The streets like a farm 'cause all we ride is horses
Let my face tell it, we done made a fortune
I'm ridin' with my dawg and he ain't gotta question
[Verse 1: Gunna]
I got a bitch like Keisha off of Belly
Police got dogs and they can't even smell me
Keep me a cup, I got a lean belly
20s on me, I call 'em green relish
Balmain my jeans, if not, they embellished
Too many vibes, they think I'm R. Kelly
PH in the sky, we got 'em already
PJ in the sky and I don't wanna land it
Creepin' at night, the VLONE bandit
I prayed to the sky and none of this was handed
Worked all my life and now I understand it
Crawled up like a mouse, but I could never tell it
I got the sweetest sauce like jelly
Try disrespect me, you all get beheaded
I got the drip, they call me Dripavelli
I held him down, that nigga was my celly
Fuck you fuck niggas, devil made me heartless
Thank God, came and got me, used to shop at Target
They cut out the coupe before we hit the market
We don't pack our bags 'cause we gon' shop regardless
Backend, I'm back in, paid up for the party
I done came a long way from openin' up for Carti
Shades and my bracelets Cartier Carti
Police's cases, all that we avoidin'
The lean in my cup gettin' more and more muddy
I shown all my love, I've never been a bully
Got every color VLONE hoodie
Just jumped in the game and still I ain't no rookie
I got this sauce, cream and puddin'
I came with the drip, got everybody lookin'
Cherish your blessings, easily could be tooken
Send a front in, it's easy to get a book in

[Chorus: Gunna]
You niggas bogus, I see the imposers
I used to sell yola, trap on Motorolla
Spittin' these vocals, labels think I wrote it
Slippery wet paints, the coupes are candy-coated
Just left the bank, I need a bag to hold this
The streets like a farm 'cause all we ride is horses
Let my face tell it, we done made a fortune
I'm ridin' with my dawg and he ain't gotta question
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Yeah, cash all my backends, I bought me a Patek
Addicted to cabbage, the money relax me
My mom and them happy, I bought them a mansion
I still rock the fitted, but I don't be cappin' (Skrrt)
These camouflage denim like I just went campin'
They still can't believe that I made it, they happy
I been gettin' money before I was rappin'
I'm ridin' in the Wraith like I play with the actors
No pleadin', arraignment, ain't takin' no charges
My young nigga's solid, I know that he got me
He keep his mouth closed, I'ma buy him a foreign
Penthouse, hotel suite whenever we're tourin'
How foreign my tint is, I still rock the Jordan
Packin' out shows, love my fans, they important
And I'm still in the trap, in the hood like a motor
Spend thousands on fragrance, she fuckin' my odor
I just started rappin', I made me some millions
Man, shout out Atlanta, I'm runnin' my city
These bracelets came healthy, they cost me a 50
I leveled it up, I've been handlin' business
Gettin' 20 a night, every day, different city
I just keep puttin' this syrup in my kidneys
This the big one, boy, this not the Jubilee (Jubilee)
I got Gunna with me, rockin' VLONE, Supreme (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Gunna]
You niggas bogus, I see the imposers
I used to sell yola, trap on Motorolla
Spittin' these vocals, labels think I wrote it
Slippery wet paints, the coupes are candy-coated
Just left the bank, I need a bag to hold this
The streets like a farm 'cause all we ride is horses
Let my face tell it, we done made a fortune
I'm ridin' with my dawg and he ain't gotta question (Uh)

Firin' at everybody
Firin' at everybody
(Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Firin' at everybody
[Chorus]
I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter the middle of the hood, I'm flyer than everybody
All this fame these niggas be chasin', I swear I don't care 'bout it
Boy, you play, you gon' die front of everybody
Leave some blood on the street, buy some red bottoms
Caught an L, but I wish that they headshot 'em
Free my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him
[Verse 1]
I used to pray for a plug who gon' go out the way
And come back with a lot of them bitches
I used to dream about condos when we leavin' Lenox
Now I stay on top of them bitches
I wouldn't give a damn if he ran him up a whole billion
I still wouldn't acknowledge the nigga
He put my name in a song, what the fuck is he on?
I don't care, boy, we gotta go get him
House big as fuck in the middle of nowhere
I dick her down, I don't care what my ho wear
I made Lil' Cam spin the block on a four-wheel
Nah, for real, spin the block on a four-wheel
Five million dollars, for me, that ain't no deal
I done made that times six in like three years
Off this rap shit, I can't even talk about this trap shit
I just hope they can take it, I keep me a stallion like Megan
A residency out in Vegas
Might fly to L.A. and go fuck with LeBron and the Lakers
Come back to Atlanta with Jayda
Bruh told us to take care of the neighbors and stack all the paper
Whatever we want, buy it later
I know how to shit on a hater and handle the business
Whatever God give me, I'm grateful

[Chorus]
I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter the middle of the hood, I'm flyer than everybody
All this fame these niggas be chasin', I swear I don't care 'bout it
Boy, you play, you gon' die front of everybody
Leave some blood on the street, buy some red bottoms
Caught an L, but I wish that they headshot 'em
Free my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him
[Verse 2]
Cartier watches for everyone 'round me
I ran it up, how the fuck could you down me?
She set for life, how the fuck could you clown her?
Bought all this water, I'm never gon' drown
I'm in the 'yo, I'm perfectin' my sound
I helped 'em out and they let me down again
I ain't comin' back around again
Fell in love and I found a friend
I done geared up the motor
My brother in prison in Polo
I jumped in the game and went loco
I put on these clothes like a hobo
That's layers of drip
I showed my ass in Phipps
You play, ya mans get killed
Said that before, but I'm dead for real
Lil' bro jumpin' 'round like his leg done healed
I ran it up off of vacuum seal
If I fall off today, I'm a legend still
Bro showed me the way, I ain't never steal
This Glock ain't no prop, it'll pop for real
I fuck with that syrup, I don't pop no pills
My young niggas turnt, they don't got no deals
I need me a billion so I can chill
I'm drivin' like I ain't got no license still
My Trackhawk move like it got nitrogen, I'm poppin' seals

[Chorus]
I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter the middle of the hood, I'm flyer than everybody
All this fame these niggas be chasin', I swear I don't care 'bout it
Boy, you play, you gon' die front of everybody
Leave some blood on the street, buy some red bottoms
Caught an L, but I wish that they headshot 'em
Free my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him
[Verse 3]
I paid attention and found out the recipe
I take a seat and they still won't get 'head of me
I'm on my shit, now a bitch can't get next to me
You ain't got a hundred thou', you can't have sex with me
Ain't showed the best of me yet
And ain't in nobody debt, I'm somethin' like a vet
I bought my big brother a 'Vette
My numbers so good, my label probably owe me a check
They play with Lil Baby, I swear it's gon' go down
The biggest lil' nigga that's over at Motown
Jumped off the porch and went straight kicked the door down
Flip the clip, switch the clip, then some more rounds
Rappers fake and be hatin', I don't go 'round
I took 12 on a chase, I had four ounces
Ask around, we them guys, I do no clownin'
If I can, I'ma try keep the smoke down
Once it's up, then it's stuck, it can't go down
Like to switch where I sleep, I got four houses
Every time the heat come, I make four thousand
Big done gave me the game and I ran with it
Milk the game 'til I quit, I ain't playin' with it
Could've been hit your bitch, I be sparin' niggas
Make me mad, I'ma call up them grave diggers
Bought my mom a new crib, and it's way bigger
Never been to it once, that's a great feelin'
I'ma go there when I get a chance
I lost five hundred racks before I signed a deal
Swear to God, I still got my advance
Yeah, I'm lit, I been savin' this guala up
Yeah, I hit, but she didn't get a follow-up
Ain't no reason to beef with no one about none of these women
I promise they swallow us all

[Chorus]
I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter the middle of the hood, I'm flyer than everybody
All this fame these niggas be chasin', I swear I don't care 'bout it
Boy, you play, you gon' die front of everybody
Leave some blood on the street, buy some red bottoms
Caught an L, but I wish that they headshot 'em
Free my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him

Cook that shit up, Quay
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I come from a different type of cloth than these niggas
I'ma buy a different type of car than these niggas
Ain't gon' fuck on none of these lil' bitches, they be hittin'
I gotta switch it up, man, I gotta move different, I'm a boss nigga
Yeah, show them youngins how to level up
Four Season hotel, sixty levels up
But I'm a resident
If you gon' do the crime, go hard, don't leave no evidence
I got 'em all on my wave 'cause it's evident
But where was y'all when I was lost, ain't know where to go?
She think I'm fly, she like my pimpin', but I can't save no ho
You only get one chance to cross me, then it's say no more
I gotta tell 'em go
I ain't hit your baby mama, I hit her with the curveball
I ain't hit your baby mama, I hit her with the curveball
And I'm still the same young hitter, used to serve y'all
Don't ever get it twisted, my youngins really flip shit
My youngins really flip shit, don't ever get it twisted
'Cause I'll really flip shit
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I don't need no friends, I just wanna win
I got this new Benz and it's all I need
She listen to her friends, they wanna get in
She don't understand that they'll slob on me
If I let 'em, ain't gon' let up, I'ma keep on stridin'
Heard they lookin' for me, I can't tell 'cause I ain't hidin'
It don't matter if I'm frownin' 'cause my mama smilin'
I done finally went legit, ain't no more public housing
I gotta stay from 'round them

[Verse 2: Rylo Rodriguez]
I'm gon' pull up AMG like I don't know my alphabet
Youngins ain't on Instagram but they still want a blue check
If 12 go'n grab one more of my dawgs, I'ma sue the vet
I thought they all wanna see me ball, they'd rather go hide the nets
All these pointers in my watch but my Rolex ain't tellin' (Hell nah)
Know the drank the devil but when I'm on it, feel like I'm in heaven
In the hood shootin' dice, ask what it playin', we told him, "7"
Used to go to church 'til I seen MC serve the reverend
Pockets gettin' biggie, no Smalls, Faith Evans
Wonder why she don't wanna fuck when I ain't wearin' my necklace
They ain't picture me like this so I sent all them selfies
Pray you don't get caught in the mix, 'cause when we slide, it's deadly
I'ma pay her for that pussy, I won't lie, they petty
Nine hundred on jeans, we came from wearin' Moschino
When the paper comin' in, it'll drive you senile
It'll drive you crazy (It'll drive you insane)
Pray you take these lines and look back, oh, they all faded
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I don't need no friends, I just wanna win
I got this new Benz and it's all I need
She listen to her friends, they wanna get in
She don't understand that they'll slob on me
If I let 'em, ain't gon' let up, I'ma keep on stridin'
Heard they lookin' for me, I can't tell 'cause I ain't hidin'
It don't matter if I'm frownin' 'cause my mama smilin'

Cook that shit up, Quay
[Chorus]
I can't fuck with shawty, know she’ll tell
Slim shit, look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy, givin' ’em hell
She ain't tryna go with me, I'ma pay her
I crush a lot, baby girl, I'm a player
Connect the dots then I plug up the scale
If we get caught, they gon' give me the chair
Fuck the law, make 'em earn what they pay 'em
[Verse 1]
Ain't no back and forth with no bitches, this ain’t tennis
Rolls Royce truck, bitch, it ain’t rented
And they braggin' ’bout bitches, I promise we hit 'em
I flooded my wrist, let the bros split a million
At this point I'm heartless I ain't got no feelings
Buy every building in the hood for my children
Like a Drake song, got your vibe feelin’ groovy
With no phone, we can make us a movie
I ain't in my bag, I still got my feet out
If we wanted smoke with y'all, you couldn't be out
Free the bros, buy my shit off the kiosk
I'm at the vibe with the spot, this the creep house
Lil' shawty suck it like she just took her teeth out
Five percent tint on the whip, you can't see out
Ready to set it off, Queen Latifah
These niggas talk like bitches, see what they be 'bout

[Chorus]
I can't fuck with shawty, know she'll tell
Slim shit, look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy, givin' 'em hell
She ain't tryna go with me, I'ma pay her
I crush a lot, baby girl, I'm a player
Connect the dots then I plug up the scale
If we get caught, they gon' give me the chair
Fuck the law, make 'em earn what they pay 'em
[Verse 2]
Ain't no complaining, money coming in
Put it all up, do it all again
First you get a mil', then it's times ten
Youngest out the crew, AMG Benz
Stand up like a man, take it on the chin
They got consequences in this life of sin
Laugh about it, go in Gucci, spend a ten
When you come home, we gon' all win
Go in any club and make it thunderstorm, this shit reckless
He gon' knock you off with his Rollie on
Drive the Rolls Royce like a hotbox, really came from nothin'
Only ride with my security because I can't be armed
Can't get caught with another gun
They gon' know me when I'm gone
They hear my pain inside my songs
It's like a switch, I cut it on
Pills kick in, gettin' in my zone
Do my job, ain't see no wrong
I'm never talkin' on them phones
Feds gon' try to do us wrong
Man, they got my nigga Long
Lately I just been alone
My cup, my strap, this microphone
Nobody know what's goin on
Just glad I made it off the road
Granddaddy showed me life is a gamble
Ever since I been on them dice
They gon' suck it up like a bowl of rice
I'ma give it to them niggas every time

[Chorus]
I can't fuck with shawty, know she'll tell
Slim shit, look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy, givin' 'em hell
She ain't tryna go with me, I'ma pay her
I crush a lot, baby girl, I'm a player
Connect the dots then I plug up the scale
If we get caught, they gon' give me the chair
Fuck the law, make 'em earn what they pay 'em

I've been riding around, yeah, hundred times around
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I been riding 'round in rental cars, tryna lay low
I'm a real soldier, boy, I really play with Dracos
Took the whole gang from out the hood and put 'em on the payroll
Having flashbacks of hittin' the red with the Karo
She just had a baby for me, so I paid to get her makeover
I was being calm, it's like it's they beg for me to take over
180 on the Range Rover, 400 on a Rolls truck (Wow)
300 on a G-Wagen (Wow), I'm a big dawg, you can add it up
Something wrong with him, he ain't addin' up
We laugh at them, they mad at us
It's a home run, I'm batter up
My earrings like baseballs
Clout chasers, I hate y'all
I don't see people like Ray Charles
Where I'm from, we don't do fraud
You a kingpin or a takegod?
[Chorus: Lil Baby & Future]
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love (Yeah)
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up (Yeah)

Really I'm a trap nigga, I can wrap a kilo (Yeah)
Sippin' sizzurp took me number one, no promo (Oh yeah)
I'm in spaceships, I'm in Mars on the low-low (Yeah, yeah)
I'm in the Phantom with the stars, feel like Fabo (Yeah)
I got million dollar stars on my payroll, huh
I feel like you different once you make it out the mud
Got a brand new Richard, I can't wait to hold it up
VV, cut it up, got all new baguettes in it, cut it up (Ooh)
One, brrt, call, that's all, brrt, pu-pullin' up (Ooh)
This bag make a bad, bad bitch call up and quit her job (Yeah)
Where I'm from you either gotta murder, if you make it out, you a god
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love (Yeah)
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up (Yeah)

FOREVEROLLING
Flexin' on that—
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I'm doin' donuts in my neighborhood, it made me feel good
I swore I would never do that shit again, but still do it
I feel better with no IG but I'm too big of influence
And live your life, don't try to make someone else have that shit might ruin you
Yeah, I make money off all type of shit, I got stocks for me and my children
Had to put the wide body on the Lamb' truck, it look sexy, call it "Mrs. Urus"
Fucked up playin' around, now I'm serious
I got two hundred bands in each ear
I was damn near the man beforе I started rappin'
These othеr niggas just cappin'
I can take the top off while the car goin'
Call it, "Gettin' nasty in traffic"
I done reached another bracket, eight figure taxes
I can't touch a bitch if she average
Any location, play, we gettin' at 'em
All this shit come and go, it don't matter
These boys subtweetin' when you ain't at 'em
We don't even social beef, we get active
Everybody killin' now 'til somethin' happen
I feel uncomfortable without a ratchet
I might shoot my shot at what you call it
I'm forever ballin', I might eat her pussy good and never call her
I been runnin' from her, I heard you a stalker
But we is not the same, lil' nigga
I been drugged through the mud, had a girl for the plug
I put numbers on the board, this is not for no awards
I get money, that's enough
If I get 'em, that's a plus
Handle business is a must
Get hurt feelings when you trust
Came from prison, didn't have nothin'
Ran it up a couple months
Bustdown Patek came from Thug
Boy, you know, that's real love
I ain't never changin' up, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
If I like you, you lucky
I'ma change your whole life like it's nothing
Girl I know not to stare when you come in
I be busy, I'm not in my comments
I be playin' with that fire like I'm John Wick
Don't be walkin' up on me
I'll be ballin' 'til 2040, I promise, I'm not for the moment
I'll be killin' that shit when I get there and wake up
And kill it again in the morning
I be chillin', but trust me, I handle the business
When it's time to get it, I zone in
I'm the same way if I'm with fifty niggas who be killin' or I'm by my lonely
I be laughin' a lot but don’t get it confused
In the blink of a eye, I click
I ain't never gon' switch

Switch for what? I give you everything you want
Bitch, for what? (Let's get it)
I call bitch right out the blue when I'm off this Perc' like, "Get this nut" (Bitch, get this nut)
If you play with my name, I'm gettin' you touched
Two hundred a show, not feelin' enough (Feelin' enough)
I like switches, they take fifties, a nigga like me hate fillin' 'em up (Ch-chic, boom)
I don't talk much, nigga like me gon' get that cash, I'm gettin' you touched (Gettin' you touched)
Molly, Percocet, mask on, no, it's off, don't give no fuck
I pay rent to lawyers, got the Lamb' truck cash
I can't rent no Goyard
Growers call growers for that weed, just to fill this order (Gang)
I know bitches act like they know Baby, so they feel important (Let's get it)
I know niggas pay niggas for safety, so they get extorted (Pussy)
I got shooters, take off half the city, I just get them Jordans (Boom, boom, boom)
Rather send off all these goofies 'round me, just not none of my shorties
My foot on the gas (Skrrt), I'm on they ass turnt
My homie just died off a bad Perc'
I'm lucky, you lucky, just ask Smurk
Put an opp inside a wood first (Woah)
You suck it good, you get a good purse
Twenty million, I was in the trenches, I just stand on business
I'm the voice, can't give out a bad verse (Verse)

Don't be walkin' up on me
I'll be ballin' 'til 2040, I promise, I'm not for the moment

Dreams 2 Reality

Al Geno on the track
G just bounced back from a headshot
Trappin' by the roadblock
I only give until my legs out
Been a real nigga 'til my legs stop
Real trapper, my legs tired
Real trapper, my legs tired
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus: NoCap]
My life was hard, it just had to be (Yeah)
Watch me turn my dreams to reality (Yeah)
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me (Yeah)
When I pop these Percs, I don't do it happily
Got a little fame, all of a sudden they change
Feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
I was so blind, I just couldn't see the hate
Forgave all them niggas, I'm still Ray
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Would have never started rappin' if I knew this shit had came with this
If I had never made a hit, would they be on my dick?
I just been sittin' back and pushin' pounds, just gettin' fit
And I got a 60 on my right wrist, I'm movin' fast like lightnin'
These other rappers tryna bite me, your baby mama wanna bite me
I swear to God she triflin', I pass her on 'cause I'm righteous
I run the jungle like Tarzan, that codeine was like poison
I cut back, I feel awesome, no playoffs but I'm ballin'
Had a good day, I scored 40 and I ain't talkin' points
I close my eyes, I still have flashbacks when I was in the joint
I hit my knees, I'm thankin' God, I'm prayin' every mornin'
I check the schedule and I'm booked up, I'm finally tourin'
I'm goin' where I wanna go, doin' what I wanna do
I can screw who I wanna screw, I came from nothin', I can never lose
Turned my dreams into reality, I thought that you'd be glad for me
I can't believe that you mad at me, damn, dawg, I'm proud of you
My life was garbage, too, but I did what I 'posed to do
And I went and bought the latest coupe, told my young nigga stay in school
But he ain't listen, now he got a .45 in the kitchen with a biscuit ready to flip it

[Chorus: Lil Baby & NoCap, NoCap, & Lil Baby]
My life was hard, it just had to be (Had to be)
Watch me turn my dreams to reality (Reality)
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me (I feel 'em after me)
When I pop these Percs, I don't do it happily (I don't do it happily)
Got little fame, all of a sudden they change
Feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
I was so blind, I just couldn't see the hate
Forgave all them niggas, I'm still Ray
[Verse 2: NoCap]
Would have never started rappin' if I knew this shit had came with this
I'm on top of all these niggas, I can see when all these angels piss
The way my nigga crossed me up, I thought his name was Chris
Don't wanna fuck around and kill my dawg, they gon' do me like I'm Vick
Yeah, they gon' really hate me if I sign a deal
I'ma go buy a Wraith, crash it on purpose, blame it on the pills
When Lil' Joe be slidin', it be look like he headed to second base
I see the hate, it look like makeup, it's all on their face
I can't see Fred no more so I be talkin' to his headstone
Sometimes I wanna catch a body, but I put my head on
Crawford finna touch down, he in the red zone
I sure got tired of sendin' him naked pictures of my red bone
Yeah, G just bounced right back off a headshot
Yeah, I won't fuck that bitch if she ain't got no ass shots
Put them choppers on the jet, we gon' air it out
25 hundred on some trap gear, we gon weigh it out
Too much dirty money, won't put that shit in the shower
Even when lights out, boy, that money still bring power
Can't serve a lot of white, but that shit look like baby powder
Got my gun at every show, I don't care if it ain't crowded
I barely sleep, but when I do, I just be dreamin'
They know I came from the bottom like bikinis
When I can't get hold to them Percs, I be fiendin'
Why would you tell me that you love me and you don't mean it?

[Chorus: NoCap]
My life was hard, it just had to be (Yeah)
Watch me turn my dreams to reality (Yeah)
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me (Yeah)
When I pop these Percs, I don't do it happily
Got a little fame, all of a sudden they change
Feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
I was so blind, I just couldn't see the hate
Forgave all them niggas, I'm still Ray
[Outro]
Would have never started rappin' if I knew this shit had came with this
I'm on top of all these niggas, I can see when all these angels piss
The way my nigga crossed me up, I thought his name was Chris
Don't wanna fuck around and kill my dawg, they gon' do me like I'm Vick
Yeah, they gon' really hate me if I sign a deal
I'ma go buy a Range, crash it on purpose, blame it on the pills
When Lil' Joe be slidin', it be look like he headed to second base
I see the hate, it look like makeup, it's all on their face

ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob
[Chorus]
It can get ugly (Huh)
Would you leave or stay like you love me?
From the bottom, all I know is the struggle
Can't get no job, so all I know is the hustle
[Verse 1]
Yeah, bankroll gettin' bigger (Nigga)
Empire gettin' built up, givin' racks to the right nigga
I can get a pack overnight, ain't nothin' like you niggas
Sippin' syrup 'til my body numb, I ain't tryna catch no feelings
I ain't never bite no nigga
She give me brain now 'cause I'm famous
I got these chains on, gettin' tangled
I'm in the big Benz, not a Wrangler
It's still a Jeep though, it ain't cheap, ho
I'm just happy they gon' free Rico
Dodgin' stank hoes and R.I.C.O.
On a Sprinter van with them Dracos
Probably ridin' around with Starlito
I'ma bust it down with my lil' bros
Buy cars for all of my kinfolk
If the sack ever did get low
God knows it's gon' be a robbery
Why the fuck everybody callin' me?
Everybody who left took a part of me
Excuse my drip, yeah, pardon me
Show me a list of who hard as me

[Chorus]
It can get ugly (Huh)
Would you leave or stay like you love me?
From the bottom, all I know is the struggle
Can't get no job, so all I know is the hustle
[Verse 2]
Right back after tour, ain't got time for no attitude
Why I cannot lose, feel like I had to do it
I'm in my savage mood, put a lil' back into it
Treat me with gratitude, I ain't no average dude
Need my rims offset like Cardi B
This might be my hardest beat
Put the blame on Pee, he started me
Got the game from Big, he guarded me
Coach threw me in, took me out the streets
Now I get racks to rap on beats
I still know plugs with packs for cheap
Killers owe favors, they'll whack for free
Never did fraud, I got cash receipts
Lotta niggas get they swag from me
Don't tell nobody 'bout bags from me
You were not in the street, you wouldn't last a week
My bitch so bad, I pass on freaks
I'm here 'cause my granny be prayin' for me
None of these niggas ain't playin' with me
Got hitters that'll sit in that can for me, yeah

[Chorus]
It can get ugly (Huh)
Would you leave or stay like you love me?
From the bottom, all I know is the struggle
Can't get no job, so all I know is the hustle, yeah

Shit, nigga just goddamn snatched one of his dawgs, now shit trippin'
You tellin' me, nigga, that ain't burn out now? What's up? (Wheezy outta here)
[Chorus: Young Thug & Lil Baby]
Started with a penny, now it's racked up to a million (Woo)
Rappin' rappin' niggas can't compare, they like my children (Yeah)
I know bitches tryna get to know a nigga 'cause his digit
You a Honda Civic whipper, in my (In what?) chameleon (Yeah)
We should start a group and we can call it New Edition
Maybe we can do it different, prolly make a hundred million (Yeah)
I come from a place between the bricks where it was hard at (Woo)
Whenever I ain't around they talkin' 'flauge, I had to fall back
[Verse 1: Young Thug & Lil Baby]
Wrist a Honda Civic, Lamborghini arms (Lamborghini)
We get plenty pussy (What?), nah-nah-nah-nah (Nah-nah-nah-nah)
Don't you call me with it (Don't you call me with it)
Boss nigga, we don't talk 'bout chickens (Brr, brr), nah-nah-nah-nah
My Rolls Royce in the projects, they look at me like I'm God
Don't ask me 'bout no such-and-such, don't speak about no charge
I just stack my money different, every ten go in a rubber band
Too much attention on these rappers, fuck it, we gon' whack their man
Some shit I don't understand, I go get it, I never ask
I don't condone that robbin', but if you slime, suggest you wear a mask
Treat my niggas and my bitches all like players, buy 'em all bags
Wish I would've answered for the homies that I can't call back

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
My dawg just lost his dawg into the system, it got me fucked up
I can't tell him nothin' negative, so I told him he gon' luck up
Had a bittersweet birthday, got a bad call in a Rolls truck (What?)
Red guts look watermelon and spaghetti and some ketchup (Hey)
All my niggas leavin' me, this shit got me depressed (Woah)
Thought he was gon' wreck the Maserati or the 'Vette
But he on the yard with the old dawgs, they at rec (Huh)
I missed a court call, what they said?
[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
No more fake text messages, leave 'em all on read (Yeah)
And this game some bullshit, but they payin' so I play it (I play it)
Cartier earrings, act like I don't hear what they be sayin' (Yeah)
Keep that shit too solid, I spent millions on my family (Woo)
None of that shit promised, I pay cash, I take chances (Woo)
I don't understand nothin', I don't want no advance
Blood on these diamonds, they look good, they dance
Big truck pull up like a blue ambulance

[Chorus: Young Thug & Lil Baby]
Started with a penny, now it's racked up to a million (Woo)
Rappin' rappin' niggas can't compare, they like my children (Yeah)

Word on the Street
39 ContributorsWord on the Street Lyrics[Intro]
We Global now
[Verse 1]
Word on the street, they got a lil' bitty hit out
Really run Atlanta, I can make a nigga get out
If anything, I have more respect for you bitches
Nigga, you a bitch, we don't shoot and miss (Nah)
Glock-19 unfold and it spit out
Double R underneath the door when I get out
Clutchin' on my fans, had to tell lil' bro to chill out
How the fuck your whole gang down the road and you still out?
Undercover rat, pussy nigga, you a sellout
Every show I get either packed or it sell out
I been ballin' hard, you on the bench, you gotta sit out
Know a nigga mad, he can't even put a hit out
Middle of the winter, drop top with a mink on
Bad lil' vibe, yeah, she say that's her theme song
I done made a whole million dollars off a flip phone
No Soulja Boy, that bitch ain't even have a ringtone
[Chorus]
Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate
We just fuck around, we don't date
I went straight up there to Mars, so they hate
And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date
I was at the bottom, literally I was boxed in
Then I took off, I ain't have no other option
I was too gone, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' yen

[Verse 2]
Call overseas, tell them youngins to spin again
I don't throw rocks and hide my hand 'cause I'm a man
Million cash in the book bag, I'm a big dog
Threw my shot at any nigga, bitch, I think I'm Chris Paul
Sippin' all these meds, nigga gotta be throwed off
I was gettin' head, fucked around and I dozed off
Rolls Royce truck, crank it and let the nose out
Everything I said, I went did it, boy, I'm the chosen child
[Chorus]
Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate
We just fuck around, we don't date
I went straight up there to Mars, so they hate
And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date
I was at the bottom, literally I was boxed in
Then I took off, I ain't have no other option
I was too gone, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' yen
[Verse 3]
Safe deposit boxes on fleek
And my bank account, I don't touch it, I'ma get it out the street
Got your vibe all on my drip, she say you cheap
And she know I'm havin' money, buy her titties, ass, and teeth
Catchin' three flights every day, the only time I get some sleep
Kept it real and they be cappin', really you can't compete
I spend it all on bullets, niggas don't wanna beef
Got a D-boy swag, pull up SRT
I ain't playin' with nobody, nobody gon' play with me
Got a driver for my car, he take me from A to Z
Got some homies on the yard I probably'll never see
If the money was the issue I promise they'd be free
They was sleepin' on me bad, they fucked around, woke up a beast
Switch it up, I went romantic, took my shawty out to Greece
Every city that I go to, gotta link up with the street
I'm too humble for 'em, guess that's why they thinkin' I was sweet

[Chorus]
Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate
We just fuck around, we don't date
I went straight up there to Mars, so they hate
And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date
I was at the bottom, literally I was boxed in
Then I took off, I ain't have no other option
I was too gone, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' yen

Pipe that shit up, TnT
Nigga came from nothing, but still they gon' hate (They gon' hate)
Whole life left me scarred, only the real can relate, yeah
Look, rich off pain
Look (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: Rod Wave & Lil Durk]
Nigga came from nothing, but still they gon' hate
Whole life left me scarred, only the real can relate
And I come straight out them trenches, in the field every day
Young nigga out that bottom, use my tears to motivate
And so much came, with this money and this fame
But I can't complain (Yeah)
I came from walking through the rain, prayed for better days
And now a nigga rich off pain
Now a nigga rich off pain (Rich off pain, yeah), rich off pain, (A nigga) rich off pain
Now a nigga rich off pain, rich off pain, (A nigga) rich off pain
Rich off pain, rich off pain, rich off pain (This shit crazy)
A nigga rich off pain (You know what I'm saying?)
(Young nigga rich off pain, young nigga rich off pain, yeah)
[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Young nigga, I was tryna get my money right
Mama support the crib with my granny, daddy servin' life
Breakin' in my auntie room 'fore school, I used a butter knife
Teacher bitchin' at me like her husband can't be fuckin' right
Wild niggas slidin' 'round in Tracks and SRTs
We stealin' packs from the older cats to buy us new Jordan 3s
I know a million niggas who millionaires off PPP's
That's how we got the address to the O-P-P's
We used stains to make it out the hood, well that's what we thought
Rob, kill, or scam, but never gon' get caught, that's just what we taught
No fist fight, but first degree murders, that's just what we fought
Gotti told us, "Never forget your dog," and that's law
I got blamed for niggas dying, I wonder why?
They say I sacrificed to be in this position, that's a lie
See, the blogs can't break me down, see, I'm the voice, I don't reply
But the rumors y'all done heard, I'ma humbly deny, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Rod Wave & Lil Baby]
Nigga came from nothing, but still they gon' hate (Yeah)
Whole life left me scarred, only the real can relate
And I come straight out them trenches, in the field every day
Young nigga out that bottom, use my tears to motivate
And so much came, with this money and this fame
But I can't complain (Yeah)
I came from walking through the rain, prayed for better days
And now a nigga rich off pain
Now a nigga rich off pain (Rich off pain, yeah), rich off pain, (A nigga) rich off pain
Now a nigga rich off pain, rich off pain, (A nigga) rich off pain
Rich off pain, rich off pain, rich off pain (This shit crazy)
A nigga rich off pain (You know what I'm saying?)
(Yeah, Baby)
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I take everything I go through and I put it in these songs
I ain't gon' never go against you, please correct me if I'm wrong
Amounted to what I show for, she'll never know what I'm on
And you can say whatever you want to, but you gon' miss me when I'm gone
I be everywhere with it on, free them runnin' it up off of strong
Ain't not one of us get the loan, ain't never fell off, I went broke before
Damn, that shit be crazy, real niggas die for something a ho done told you
Take whatever come with it, don't show no emotion
I'm back in that mode, bruh
I get impatient about that money, "what's the hold up?"
I gotta do this shit for my kids, now they growin' up
Win, lose, or draw, but no matter what, it ain't no hoing us
Lookin' at the phone, I saw you callin'
I am way too far to turn back now, I swear, I'm all in
I know it get rough, but you stay tough and keep shit solid
The Brabus truck got G800 on the back and it got stars in it
I'm just tryna show my young niggas they can ball too
Anytime I ever hit her up, she know imma fall through
I done ran up millions off this pain shit
I don't like to deal with her too much 'cause it's the same shit
(Uh, yeah-yeah)

They can't wait to tell a nigga's business

I'm one of the real ones, tunnel vision on the way to the millions
Keep me a check, flooded Patek
I fuck with lil shawty, I bought her a Rollie
Pussy niggas tellin' lies, they don't know me
The same niggas talkin' down probably owe me
You a big dawg and I'm a big dawg but they know their motherfuckin' difference
Pushin' pounds, LA Fitness

(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
[Verse 1]
I been the type of guy she like since middle school
Never thought that I'd get famous, always know that I'd be cool
Could've been fucked on shawty, I just didn't wanna be rude
Eliantte diamonds, I want the finest for your jewels
And my hitter 'dem be slidin', don't put cameras on my crew
I ain't doin' too bad, I'm somebody, you can Google me
I ain't never worried 'bout what they say that they gon' to do me
I just put in overtime, I'm doin' numbers like it's two of me
That was back then, times change, this a newer me
Money conversations at the table, I speak fluently
Stay away from bad vibes, I can't see no nigga doing me
Still give a couple thousand, even though she would of did it free
They don't treat me like no rapper 'cause my vibe like I'm in the streets
I'm one of the top five, it ain't too many guys as real as me
I barely get sleep, I'm tryna make sure everybody eats
Took a trip to overseas, I'm buyin' drip in other currencies
I'm on fire right now, and it ain't somethin' that's just currently
And a bitch told a lie if she told you she was curvin' me
And we all big dawgs, ain't gon' let my people work for me
911, we got a problem, it's an emergency, yeah
[Chorus]
I heard that crime pays (Uh)
They think we thugs 'cause we got ice, I'm going plain jane
No matter what, at least a quarter for my main thing
Showed up on Forbes, I can't complain, I'm tryna maintain
Hop off a plane, pick up a check, then do the same thing
I heard that crime pays
They think we thugs 'cause we got ice, I'm going plain jane
No matter what, at least a quarter for my main thing
Showed up on Forbes, I can't complain, I'm tryna maintain
Hop off a plane, pick up a check, then do the same thing

[Verse 2]
Lately, I been diggin' your vibe
I can tell by the look in your eyes
That you need to get some shit off your mind
I give you my time, give you jets in the sky
Have you runnin' 'round in laps for me
I perform, when I'm done, you should clap for me
You got problems on your head, you can chat with me
Have you runnin' around the globe chasing racks with me
M's in plastic, sometimes I'm sarcastic
I just like to hear laughter, tryna ease all this pain
Took off fast, I know they hate how I passed 'em
Don't gotta be in the grave, they throwin' dirt on your name, yeah
[Chorus]
I heard that crime pays, uh
They think we thugs 'cause we got ice, I'm going plain jane
No matter what, at least a quarter for my main thing
Showed up on Forbes, I can't complain, I'm tryna maintain
Hop off a plane, pick up a check, then do the same thing
I heard that crime pays
They think we thugs 'cause we got ice, I'm going plain jane
No matter what, at least a quarter for my main thing
Showed up on Forbes, I can't complain, I'm tryna maintain
Hop off a plane, pick up a check, then do the same thing

Two hundred hoes, thirty black trucks
All of us known for puttin' on that stuff
I let her go, ain't no handcuffs
I get a hard-on when them bands come (Yeah)
These niggas too loose, need to tighten up
Took her to Hermès, got her items up
Boy, they done fucked up and let Spider home
Free the guys down the road gotta hide the phone
Got my name from the street, not a microphone
Ain't no sleep, she on two, I took Adderall
Niggas act like they us, but they not at all
Copped the baddest shit out, we forgot the car (Yeah)
I put diamonds in my teeth like I'm Paul Wall
Pretty titties, her whole body so soft
Hold the back of her head 'til her jaws lock
I don't care what he do, he a cornball
Extra layers, I'm dressin', I'm Stiff Gang
I'm the real one, two million on pinky ring
Come through pimpin' like Pinky without the cane
Niggas thinkin' they hot, but they Eddy Cane
I've been puttin' on this stuff since my baby frame
Walk around with a dollar, that's pocket change
Niggas think that you smart 'til you knock his brain
I done Brabus'd the Rover like I'm La Flame
Me and Ski tryna see who the colder shit
If I see her with bro, I don't know the bitch
Extra stuff every time, extra stuff every time
Extra stuff every time when I'm steppin' out
Put on stuff every time, put on stuff every time
Put on stuff every time when I'm steppin' out

Bought number two a new whip, she got drive
Bought number three a new Guc', she suck dick

Fit In
32 ContributorsFit In Lyrics[Intro]
Earl on the beat
[Chorus]
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind
[Verse 1]
I had a carbon I was fifteen
We tryna steal and rob everything
I can't even talk about what I seen
I'm never telling the laws a thing
Made it out alive, can't even lie that shit was awesome nigga
Shootouts I ain't had no bullets I had to call some niggas
Lost lil Juan in the middle of the summer, that shit was awful nigga
As soon as we found out some witness who tell us who did it, we gon' off them nigga
Had to cut off a couple niggas I thought was with me, tried to cross a nigga
These niggas think they can just come and kick shit in my city, it's gon' cost them niggas
Jumped in the game and went got me some millions, no cap
I made a wave for us
Them bitches weren't fucking with me when I didn't have no money, now they can't wait to fuck
Every one of my lil buddies mama know we thuggin', that's why they pray for us
I was in the back of the Bach like Rosa Parks
Me and my dogs on Tec, a four or more
Grind every day like it ain't no tomorrow
I was just broke, ain't going back
I'ma run mines up to the max
I want the cheese, ain't fuckin' with rats
I wanna fuck her I give her a rack
If she don't give me head ain't texting her back
I'm a dog I go deep in the cat
Remember one time I ain't have jack
I had a hunnid I bought me a pack
I took the pack and went got me a bag
It started rolling and coming in fast
I had the old heads hanging back
Now I'm rich now and that's why they mad

[Chorus]
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind
[Verse 2]
Putting on for the hood like I'm White Boy Marco or something
Super fast car, super bad broad, everybody know a nigga getting money
Couple homies switched up on me when I blowed up now I look at them funny
I put the four on my back with no shirt on
I let the homies get bags for the low low
We sending bricks out the spot this the o-zone
I'm the man, rest in peace Shawty Lo
I take the whole gang on the road
Long way from in front of the store
They don't wanna fly they wanna hit the road
They wanna take pistols to all of my shows
We thuggin' in public wherever we go
I did some shit that don't nobody know

[Chorus]
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz

My diamonds hit harder when the light off
I ride private to my shows, just a write-off
This beat from Murda (Murda)
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Got a thousand pounds for a thousand, buy them bitches now
First they tried to steal my style, now they tryna steal my sound
Thank God, I ain't been broke in a while
Do what I do to a T, you my child
I left the bitch in the field and she sour
Move like a ghost in my town, I got power
Reach for a chain on my neck, hear a baow
I'm hittin' 'em hard, make 'em throw in the towel
Don't get 'em started, if you ask me, I'm the hardest
Ain't come to play with these boys, I ain't Carti
AMG big body, sound like it farted
I hurt they feelings, ain't telling' 'em sorry
These niggas boring, I'm on some more shit
Hundred racks spent on my teeth, I like flossin'
Ran up ten million and still ain't get cocky
Fuck your opinion, don't need it, I'm poppin'
Told all the bros catch an opp, then he droppin'
Everyone hot on my label, got options
Send your deposit, we come to rock shit
Breakin' in cars, my lil' bro like a locksmith
That nigga throw it up, he on them Roxies
Why you keep buyin' these chains and these watches?
How can I not? Every day I get profit
Upped all my drip 'cause my Crips be watchin'
I really go from these projects to projects
They gotta take it with ease, they can't stop it
Fuck it, ain't letting' 'em breathe, they can die
Think 'bout the bros every time I get high
Free the guys
Baby

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
My diamonds hit harder, I ain't in no competition
Not to mention, just a lil' bit richer, can't forget that (Nah)
Flew here, we got chartered (Chartered)
Shawty, she so raw, I might just let her have my daughter
Naw, I'm trippin', yeah, forget that
This the get-back, yeah
[Verse 2: Rylo Rodriguez]
Had a lil' ten bands, I spent that shit on denim
I pull up Usain Bolt Trackhawk, this is not no rental, yeah
Project runner, I came up playin' cops and robbers
You the guy with the badge, and I'm the nigga with the chopper
My niggas catch bodies in the daytime (Yeah, yeah)
VLONE Runtz, this shit won't make it past a canine
I know real trappers that stay on the block, but they don't play lines
But if they see 12, they know to run, though, like they Rajon
I stack that shit up to the ceiling, no more sharin' clothes
I bought a pendant, came from Wafi, but I ain't proposed
Ridin' with an AR, but he got murked with a revolver
I sent the crackhead in the pharmacy for cough syrup
No, she can't play me, but if she try, I'ma dog her
They been askin' questions crazy, "Is you 'bout to drop a tape yet?"
"Is you tryna go independent? Rylo did you sign with Baby?"
Rolex like G-Shock to us, that's 'cause we finally made it

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
My diamonds hit harder, I ain't in no competition
Not to mention, just a lil' bit richer, can't forget that (Nah)
Flew here, we got chartered (Chartered)
Shawty, she so raw, I might just let her have my daughter
Naw, I'm trippin', yeah, forget that
This the get-back
My diamonds hit harder, I ain't in no competition
Not to mention, just a lil' bit richer, can't forget that (Nah)
Flew here, we got chartered (Chartered)
Shawty, she so raw, I might just let her have my daughter
Naw, I'm trippin', yeah, forget that
This the get-back, yeah

Only love could bring us
Bring us to this bitter plane
[Verse 1]
I know that I'm beneficial, I can't show no feelings, Bentley windows tinted
Nowadays ain't no time for me to kick it, business too intensive
They gon' say that I been actin' different, I'm beyond they mental
I moved on from slangin' drugs and pistols, can't be thinkin' simple
Tighten up my circle, someone in the camp been leakin' info
The Maybach triple black, this shit relaxin', feel like I'm in a limo
I pull through the hood to let 'em see, I let down all the windows
I know I'm the motivation, they see me, they see a hero
Lot of niggas rich, but it hit different when you come from zero
They know I bang C's but every day I need a different B roll
Super supertitious, ask my niggas, I still pick up pennies
You can't give attention to these bitches when your name get mentioned
If I don't kill him, he gon' be in critical condition when I'm finished with him
Some shit just can't faze you when you been that nigga
Brodie died, that shit had me all sentimental
Cuz got life in jail, I pray to God they overturn his sentence
[Chorus]
I got too much money for my mom to work a job, I know she proud now
Sensei to these bitches, when they see me, they gon' bow down
I made real niggas win again, we back in style now
And I got that blicky for that rah-rah
I go to the dealership with checks soon as the car drop
My new house got slidin' glass doors, don't got no doorknobs
I'm in charge, I'm always gon' go hard, you just do your part
And no matter what, know if you get up, then you lose your spot

[Verse 2]
You can say whatever but if I change it's for the better
That shit was painful but I ain't let up, I left a stain in the ghetto
Been inside the mix since a lil' jit, got my name from the ghetto
But I'm bigger now I can go to dinner with Corey Gamble and Miss Jenner now
Couple hundred grand up on the 'Gram before it went in style
They'll call me like, "Take it down", I been the one
Bossed up, I don't gotta do it, but I'ma get her done
I man up and handle my problems when I can easily run
Easy come, easy go, sell it all, get some more
We done made it to another year, I'm swappin' out my cars again
Everything is the latest, can't complain 'cause I made it
Who am I gon' judge?
I don't never hold nuts, I don't never hold grudges
Went to Miami for a concert, hit Chanel store for my baby
I spent three hundred on a Mercedes, if I keep goin', I'll be the greatest
I bust out cryin' and I wasn't sad, it's just a little feelin' you get when you make it
I done tried, tried, tried and tried and tried again, I can't even fake it, yeah
[Chorus]
I got too much money for my mom to work a job, I know she proud now
Sensei to these bitches, when they see me, they gon' bow down
I made real niggas win again, we back in style now
And I got that blicky for that rah-rah
I go to the dealership with checks soon as the car drop
My new house got slidin' glass doors, don't got no doorknobs
I'm in charge, I'm always gon' go hard, you just do your part
And no matter what, know if you get up, then you lose your spot

[Outro]
Only one of us
Who's gonna walk away?
Here in the deep below
That only darkness really knows

Stand On It
36 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolStand On It Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here we go again (Okay), big body Benz (Skrrt)
Cut off all my friends (Yeah), choppers for my enemies
Go and ask the streets about lil' Dominique, I been a beast
Really got my name from shootin' dice and sellin' niggas weed
557, .223s, 308s go through a car door
All the houses paid off, none of my hoes ain't got no car note
Sell a thousand, scream, "Free Ralo"
"Baby, you should stop it," I know
Everything's a profit, for sure
Pilot waitin' on us, let's go
Still be in the projects with ColdHearted and Q Ball
Wreck the 'Rari, buy a new one tomorrow, I'm too raw
I got foreigns all colors, like a pack of Starburst
When they ask me how it happened, I just tell 'em, "God works"
I'm tryna touch me a billi', still hustle like I'm on zero
Really done saved some niggas, that's why they call me the hero
Trappin' like this shit legal, I'm tryna uplift my people
I used to serve in a regal, I turned 'em into believers, yeah
I don't want your bitch, we can't swap out (Swap out)
They ain't on shit, tell 'em pop out (Pop out)
Mama, I got rich, look at your drop out (Drop out)
Guns up, it ain't nothin' to talk 'bout (Guns up)
[Chorus]
Outside in your city, lookin' good (Lookin' good)
It's a Draco' call it "Wish a nigga would" (It got wood on it)
And she think that she special, but I'm good on her (Good on her)
Handle business like I'm 'posed to, everything I say, I stood on it
Outside in your city, lookin' good (Lookin' good)
It's a Draco' call it "Wish a nigga would" (It got wood on it)
And she think that she special, but I'm good on her (Good on her)
Handle business like I'm 'posed to, everythin' I say, I stood on it

[Verse 2]
My life really a miracle, my bitches say I'm magical
I still fuck with lil' Critical, I ran through more then half of them
I put on for that avenue, I had to bust my ass for this (Word)
How a bitch who never even met me gon' try to tell my business?
How someone I only had sex with once gon' try to have a kid by me?
Once you cross that line, you dead, really, that's how it is with me
Brodie got rich off of Percs, he sell 'em twenty-five a piece
My lil' scammin'-ass bitch made quarter-million in a week
I ain't never thirsty, run into a ho and don't even speak
Got that blick' on me in public, hope they think it's only me
This shit different, they gotta go through my assistant, just to reach me
If nobody else gon' show 'em, I'll teach 'em (I'll teach 'em)
[Chorus]
Outside in your city, lookin' good (Lookin' good)
It's a Draco' call it "Wish a nigga would" (It got wood on it)
And she think that she special, but I'm good on her (Good on her)
Handle business like I'm 'posed to, everything I say, I stood on it
Outside in your city, lookin' good (Lookin' good)
It's a Draco' call it "Wish a nigga would" (It got wood on it)
And she think that she special, but I'm good on her (Good on her)
Handle business like I'm 'posed to, everything I say, I stood on it

[Verse]
I'm smoking loud this that moonrock
They tryna sue me cause I'm gettin' paper
I dropped out of school didn't get no education
My momma, she happy 'cause I finally made it
She living better, her house big as fuck
Buy her a Bentayga Bentley truck
With a AP today, tomorrow switch it up
Honeycomb diamonds VVS's cuttin'
Standing on stage, I really came from nothing
I took me a break, don't mean I'm getting rusty
I'm gaining this weight they say I'm getting husky
I stand on front line I'm all about the fuckery
I go where I want, nobody better not fuck with me
Extended the glizzy shoot it 'til it's empty
I come from the projects jumping over fences
I found me a plug and went and made a killing
I think we in love we should just have some children
Them narcs I been sipping got to have me trippin'
I didn’t come to play I had to reinvent me
I handled my business now I'm worth some millions
Remember the safe deposit box was empty
Them niggas weren't fucking with me they weren't friendly
If you weren't with me then, you ain't seeing him with me
We like Kanye and K, you like Bobby and Whitney
Real dope boy I ain't nothing' like the weirdos
Never seen me putting on the weird clothes
It cost a lil' more when it's real gold
We already up keep the field goal
Remember that day that I had lost all that cake
I had to go in the safe
I had to get me a pot and cook that shit up
Had 'em calling me Quay
I had got that shit back in like twenty-some-days
Ain’t no chump change, I’m talkin' bout' 500k
I went straight to the lot and went bought me a wraith
Ain't no more being humble put it in they face
I won't feed in the drama I'm loving the hate
But one thing for sure, Lil Baby go crazy

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Under thirty, made the Forbes list, I'm a walking script, record me
This a .30 and a .40, switch make it hit fast as hell
Bitch told me she pray for me, told her pray for brodie'n'em in the cell
I don't got no stylist, Marni shoes and pants, I'm fresh as hell
Yes I know what happened, I ain't no rat, so I ain't gon' never tell
You can follow Baby, won't lead you wrong, bro, I ain't gon' never fail you
Big was tryna show me the right way to go, I was so rebellious
Whatever they doin' don't bother me, bro I'm oh so careless
You the type of guy that want the "I" for rеal, you all so selfish
I'm the type of guy rеady to die for this shit if it gon' prevail us
I can't slip, look at this shit I've built, I know they tryna nail us
Give her two or three thousand off the rip, she said she want her nails done
Cuban links on just because, this shit really from the mud
We handled the business like gentlemen, I can't rock with thugs
Jeff can get ten M's if he needed it, you know I rock with Thug
All my niggas jack in the boxes, playin', we poppin' up
[Part II]
[Verse 2: Nardo Wick]
Pop up with them switches on
Pop up with that shit on (Shit on)
Pop up like my granny, grandma, granny, lot of chains on (Lot of chains)
I might pop up with your bitch, later on I'll send her home
I heard he heard I hit his bitch, so he don't like to hear my songs
She said "Wick you made me sick," how when I'm your medicine (Your medicine)
Ain't gay, don't go that way at all, but I love that nigga Benjamin
Chop stick, grrah-bah-bah-bah-bah (Grrah), keep that for the robber men
Foreign fabric, cars, and hoes (And hoes), I'm the only thing American
I done stuffed a million in the duffle, smurf dollars blue color (Skrrt)
Pull up big body Brabus trucks the new Hummers (Skrrt, skrrt)
Told me I lay the pipe right, I'm her new plumber
It's hard to interact with people, I come from the jungle (Uh-huh)
We some animals in designer clothes and jewelry
How we got the same cars they drove in Fast and Furious? (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Uh, she ask me, do I love her, I say, "You can't be serious," uh
Cold-hearted, touch my chest and you gon' burr

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Super fast, I hit the gas, you hear her skrr-rr
Twenty-two, five, lil' rico got him pure
I was standin' on the block tryna get a rack to buy a Buick
Now I'm trim, Lamborghini boy, I know you seen that Urus
If I ever run into your bitch, your love life gon' be ruined
Take a break, but ain't gon' never gonna stop, this shit to be continued
From a traphouse, beatin' down the doors to packin' out the venue
When they catch him, they gon' eat him up, I put him on the menu
Put piranhas on yo' ass, three, four hundred on your ass
Get the switch, she actin' bad, like your mama on your ass
My first deal was worth a couple mil', I still was sellin' bags
Maggot bitches trying to tackle me, I'm stiff armin' they ass
Google said my net worth five mil', I got that shit in cash
Everyday my life go up and up, it's hard for me to get mad
I'm established, I might pop out, Cactus Jack on like I'm Travis
They act happy, but as soon as you turn your back, they try to stab you
I done manifested this shit, as soon as I see it I'm gonna grab it
I act humble, but you can go and check my numbers, I ain't average
I be hearin' shit, bout you old washed up niggas, I be laughin'
You don't hear nothing 'bout my young niggas, cause they know to put on a mask

Crazy
39 ContributorsCrazy Lyrics[Intro]
Really made a way when it wasn't a way to be made
[Verse 1]
Kanye crazy 'bout it, I ain't gon' play about it
Not a broad when I'm talkin' 'bout this paper
You can play if you want to
I let 'em say what they want to, I'm ready for all of this shit
No matter how hard it can get
That boy on the top of the list
I put up a wall and block all of this shit
Stay on my feet, I can't fall a lil bit
They killed my man, we was all a lil sick
Tryna get to a point where we all can get rich
Go all the way, ain't no stoppin' this shit
They respect it of course, but it's still a lil' tension (Hold on)
Still in the cut, I just darken the tints (Hold that)
There's a trophy on every last one of my wrists
Take care of every last one of my bitches
I fuck around, put my heart in this shit, but you sold out
Fuck I look like letting you get over?
I never talk on the pillow
They get a bond, they get bailed out
How many you chargin' to mail out?
Soon as they land, we gon' sell out
Hope vacuum seals keep the smell out
Snitch on the gang, you a sellout
I tried to tell 'em to "Chill out"
Beat all the trials, you can get out
Keep that shit on when you step out
It's only goin' one way (My way), seven mill' in one day, yeah (Flash)
Run it up and invest in shit
Heart broke when they made him sick
Can't find time for relationships
Van Cleef, Cartier bracelets
I'm a shootin' star, you can make a wish
Startin' to feel like I was made for this?
If they don't, I will, I see life for what it is
Tryna spend a dub on a crib
Make some more time for my kid
Everybody solid who I'm with
Spend it when it's time to get spent (Spend it)
Send 'em when it's time to get sent (Send it)
Uh, Baby made a way for himself
They want credit for shit they ain't did
She back outside, I'm in the field
If I catch you, you know what it is
That's right, she get the biz' (I don't play)
Yeah right, you in the middle (I don't play)
You get left there for straddlin' the fence (Stupid)
I'm prepared for whatever they send

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm know where I'm goin', they callin' me crazy
I know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Yeah
I know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
I know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Yeah
[Verse 2]
They think I'm crazy the way that I'm spendin' this money
I ain't goin' out like Mike Tyson
I'm in that mode, super cool on you friendly-ass hoes
If I like her, she gotta be feisty
Why every time that I turn around, one of these rappin'-ass niggas be actin' just like me?
In the back of the Maybach, I'm sightseein'
My lil' nigga still robbin', free Shiesty (Free bro)
I went all the way there on a boat, I ain't stoppin'
I'm all the way up on the low, I can pop it
You niggas can't get it, I'm first when they drop it
My billionaire partner just told me to step on 'em (Don't stop)
Can't turn my back on nobody that's there for me
I ain't trippin' on you bae, don't trip on me
All this money on me don’t make me the big homie
Put in work, got the hood on steroids
This for the times we had no lights and no water
Mama stressin' herself to make ends meet
I done went on a sixty month winnin' streak
Brodie wanted for murder, this shit deep
I be always on go, barely get sleep (Nah)
Love my family to death, but we barely speak
I be all around the globe, makin' sure we eat (Forever)
Really know what I'm doin', I'm from the streets

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm know where I'm goin', they callin' me crazy
I know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Yeah
I know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
I know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Yeah

(Run that back, Turbo)
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Tryna make a change
Tryna make a dollar when I only had some change
Sittin' inside a one man cell, I tightened up my brain
I can't fuck with all of y'all, I'm tightenin' up my game
I'm too far for me to complain
No one came as hard as I done came, fasho
I could've kept going, but I made a lane for bro
That's what you 'posed to do
If any nigga overstep they boundaries, you supposed to shoot
And it's enough money in it for all of us, I'll post your music
I know that this shit is a façade, I ain't gon' let 'em fool me
I can't put my trust inside no broad, I ain't gon' let 'em use me
I done put her hеart inside my pocket, I ain't gon' nevеr lose it
I done had to stand in front of the judge, and tell her I'm a user
Damn, go to sleep, we fucking
Wake up, then we fussing
Baby, we can't force it
Love will run its course
I'll make you call my name until you lose your voice
Me and money married, we fuck off as a couple
I'm takin' uppers, 'cause I don't like to be down too much
But I sip syrup, and I don't play around too much
Take my word, you can't just be down with us
We put in work
Half a ticket on a Phantom just to ride around Atlanta
My lil' boys gon' make the Forbes list
Dress my mom up for these award shows
I'm just happy it ain't court dates
I ride 'Raris, I don't horseplay
I'm a grown ass man, gotta have a blicky when I land
You keepin' your business clean, everyone trying to endorse you
I will never stick my dick in no one I pay child support to
I've been tryna build a fortune, got millions for my niece and nephew
I've been playing in a trampoline, whoever falling, I'ma catch you
If you wanna play, that shit so sour, you know I would've helped you
How the fuck you leaving? Without me, it ain't no going in
All a nigga told me it was free, but I still gave him ten
We do what we want, it ain't no asking

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Take your Rollie off when you sliding, they say, "Time will tell"
You gon' die, get you some money, or you go to jail
All these choppers will turn this city to a living Hell
It was crowded on the elevator, I took the stairs
Lost some people on the way up, but I don't even care
I can't keep you, but for the night, I want to please your body
I want to please your body, I
[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
If it ain't no Wock' then I drink Tris
Can't no promoter book my bitch
Can't name a nigga from Chicago ever said they took my shit
I can't post up like a killer knowing them niggas killed my twin
We gon' spin 'til we get dizzy, we gon' spin 'til we see him
Child support did me wrong, tried to get me out a M
Only time I hear from them when I post money on my 'Gram
When to Herman, I need a big kit on my Lamb'
She a Ifa, so she keeping on her beads when she praying
My lawyers dogs, when I call, they get richer by the case
I got niggas fuck with dogfood and get richer by the day
I know watches, your shit fake, I could tell a Richard by its face
Real nigga when I'm around y'all, I be feeling out of place
The industry ain't let me in, the judge ain't let me travel then
Ain't no solid Percs, I might go check one of them capsules in
And I know some hoes that run they mouth, that's why I don't never see 'em
All my diamonds GIA, certified them
No cap, got a top tier bitch, she my side bitch
Bitches from the trenches claim they kids on they taxes
How you dressing better than your kids? You need your ass kicked
A laugh, he wasn't matching, now he matching with his casket

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Take your Rollie off when you sliding, they say, "Time will tell"
You gon' die, get you some money, or you go to jail
All these choppers will turn this city to a living Hell
It was crowded on the elevator, I took the stairs
Lost some people on the way up, but I don't even care
I can't keep you, but for the night, I want to please your body
I want to please your body, I

So Sorry

I'm so sorry, baby, I'm so sorry
Baby, I'm so sorry, baby, I'm so sorry
[Verse 1]
I thought you was my friend, I thought we was locked in
But that's what I get for always thinkin'
You really was my twin, I put overtime in
Been talkin' to God, tryna shake His hand
Got me tatted on your skin, I ain't tryna force it
I'm knowin' that all good things come to an end
I got so many questions, know you got the answers
I just don't know how I should ask
Like, what you was doin' when I called and you didn't answer?
I seen the new Hermès on your arm, where you get that from?
Like, why are you always half-naked up on your platforms?
You told me he tried, but you ain't go, you think I'm that dumb?
You ready to see me movin' on, you think you that numb?
Why take advantage of a nigga who really cared for you?
I left ten thousand roses on the stairs for you
Hopе you don't slip and fall on my love
Take care of your bills, you ain't gotta worry 'bout nothin'
Out with your friеnds on the first of the month
No inconsistence, I'm there for you, constantly
Startin' to think you don't think you the one for me
Ain't talked in weeks, how the fuck you gon' run from me?
Know what they said, but I'm sayin' it wasn't me
Always in bullshit, they say that you done for me
Without me, I don't see how you functionin'

[Chorus]
Baby, let's get fly and go to a new planet, we won't see nobody
I'm with some known killers, and that shit on paper, brodie, like four bodies
Remember my nose snotty, now I do two shows and go cop a Bugatti
I know that you're so tired of my apologies, but, baby, I'm so sorry
Baby, let's get fly and go to a new planet, we won't see nobody
I'm with some known killers, and that shit on paper, brodie, like four bodies
Remember my nose snotty, now I do two shows and go cop a Bugatti
I know that you're so tired of my apologies, but, baby, I'm so sorry

[Verse 2]
You only sorry because you got caught
I seen you with him in some shit that I bought
Ain't trippin' about it, ain't sippin' about it
You know you're the flyest, you really the one
Turn off my phone, get some peace on a island
She antisocial, with me, she be wildin'
Cold blooded gangster, I still got emotions, though
Vintage Chanel, we went shoppin' in Tokyo
Spendin' time with you, wine and dinin' you
Spend my life with you, I won't lie to you
I admire you, bust that fire for you
You ever been with a soldier?
I'll overly mold you, that other bitch old news
I know I was gon' have you one day, I told you
I'm not the guy they tryna make me, I showed you
I'll make the whole world talk 'bout you, I'll post you
I love on you hard, hope we don't grow apart
Buy you every new car just to say that you got it
I'm knowin' your size, I'll buy it and surprise
Everything we do private, let's go to Dubai

[Chorus]
Baby, let's get fly and go to a new planet, we won't see nobody
I'm with some known killers, and that shit on paper, brodie, like four bodies
Remember my nose snotty, now I do two shows and go cop a Bugatti
I know that you're so tired of my apologies, but, baby, I'm so sorry
Baby, let's get fly and go to a new planet, we won't see nobody
I'm with some known killers, and that shit on paper, brodie, like four bodies
Remember my nose snotty, now I do two shows and go cop a Bugatti

Boss Bitch
23 ContributorsBoss Bitch Lyrics[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I got too many hoes I can't fuck 'em all
Don't know how to play but I ball
Stacking that money up make it tall
Ooh, the ice on my neck got me frost
Mama ain't made no hoe, she made a boss
My diamonds they shine when the lights turned off
Rocking designer I'm dripping in sauce
All of my diamonds real so they cost
You know it costs to live like this
I got a bad lil boss bitch
Too many diamonds, camera glitch
Yeah I'm shining, I'm frostbit
Ain't got to tell them they know that I'm rich
I got a sack like I run the blitz
Ice cold like I got on mitts
Ice cream I look like a lick
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I made a hunnid in two days
Neighbour trippin' cause I keep the door swangin'
I drop a mixtape today, they gon' be thinking I got me a ghostwriter
AMG on the floor like a low rider
Having rich arguments my whole problem
Running money up I don't see nobody
Buying lawyers for bro 'cause them folks got 'em
Tennis chains on fleek, I could wear a new piece every week
Me and my diamonds all on pee, point
Ask about me, I dug deep for 'em
Hit the bitch Curry, three-point
I can't hit them all so I Pikachu
I don't text 'em I just stick and move
Fresh pair of Loubs

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I got too many hoes I can't fuck 'em all
Don't know how to play but I ball

Yeah I'm shining, I'm frostbit
Ain't got to tell them they know that I'm rich
I got a sack like I run the blitz
Ice cold like I got on mitts
Ice cream I look like a lick
[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Forty pointers that's a waffle cone
Ice cubes on my neck like my styrofoam
Drip, dripping like they left the shower on
Them ain't real, them diamonds are rhinestones
I'm straight I got the iron now
Too many hoes bought another phone
I apologize, AP honeycomb
Shorty walking round with like three hunnid on
Baby vanilla, my rose gold match the Gucci with rose petal
Trapper of the year I need a gold medal
You know the water make the pussy get wetter
Ooh, can't name a nigga that do it better
I got too many hoes like I'm Hugh Hefner
Different foreign bitches, I'ma put 'em together
Yeah they know I'm a trendsetter

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I got too many hoes I can't fuck 'em all
Don't know how to play but I ball

(You made this shit, Pharaoh)
[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
How she acting funny? I bought her her titties
Nigga she be fuckin' ain't none of my business
Upping my quota, that's a part of my Fendi
Don't matter where I'm at, bitch, I'm known for the trenches
We the first niggas put drums in the city
We robbed the niggas, put drugs in the city
Fuck where you from 'cause I know that you with it
Check on his ass, I'ma handle my business
Trust you enough to fuck you more than once
And you gotta be a killer just to hang with us
If you talkin' 'bout murders, there's no hangin' up
Run up on 'em, BOW, ain't no onе-on-one
I got the money, so who I'm runnin' from?
I got a lawyеr that cost a honey bun
Before I buy pussy, I'll buy a hundred guns
Judge told me nigga died with my gun
2010 Reese said Ralph Lauren
Died close, feel like he died in my arms
Reinstated, they denied my bond
A nigga play with Smurk, he not that smart
Sucked it twice and I'm still not hard
Niggas cry out loud when they gettin' shot
That nigga word don't stand on my block
Fuck what you heard, I'm the man of my block

Yeah, we runnin' game on them, boy gotta sit out
After I hit, tell Amir, "Make her get out"
Hundred mil come and I still ain't gon' chill out
I'm really down, I'ma show how I'm get down
Hard on the bitch, man, I should've been pimpin'
Hard in these streets, the majority with me
You can't be serious, you gotta be kiddin' me
I'm really laughin', these lil' niggas temptin' me
I get offended when niggas say, "Tap in"
I bought lil' bro 'nem Celine just to trap in
I got more clothes in my closet than Saks Fifth
I watched JB make a deuce do a backflip
I know you really don't know, you just act hip
I done took off for real, now how that feel?
Bro ain't never gon' change, I know that's real
Just run outta here, straight to the backfield
I sleep good every night, now I'm happy
"How you go where you go?" I'm a trapper for real
"How you know what you know?" I adapted for real
We too rich with the feds, we put shit in the mail
My lifestyle expensive, this shit high as hell
Lil' bro tryna score, so I gave him a layup
I gotta go somewhere, no I can't lay up
Bitch, stop playin', you better not tell

I ain't have to sell you no dream
I said what it was, you didn't believe me
You be the cake and I be the cream
Now I look up and then she was leaving
I'm on the way, cannot be late
Speedin' through traffic like I'm in a race
I wanted it now, she want me to wait
I'm one of a kind, so you gotta taste it
Granddad died, knew I would make it
I'm a real one, you can't fake that

I got rich, this shit still don't faze me
You only get one call, I can't chase 'em
Might take one shot, a lil' chaser
Stayin' up now for us to fuck later
Mama used to tell me times would get greater
Cartier diamonds blockin' these haters
Dior drip, shit gettin' tapered
I just spent a Bentley truck with lil' Tatum
Favor for favor, nigga, I don't pay them
Get off my dick, nigga, we don't play them, yeah
Look like it, we don't stay here
Makin' half a million dollar plays, juggs

Now I got 'em mad, I'm turnin' livid
[Verse 2]
My cars come with stars and kits
None of my kids gon' starve for shit
You weren't even here when I started this
All the drugs I sold, all the shit I took
I done seen so much, I can write a book
Ain't stuntin' that ho, I can buy that look
Clothes off, how your body look?
I been 'bout business, I'm still a crook
I get in my mode, they all be shook
Said that's your bro, y'all all get pushed
You was in the house on punishment
I was in the hood sellin' strong ass kush
Your cuz came through with that Reggie Bush
Give me style and credit for all his looks
Sold-out shows in the DMV
Now Shaquille O'Neal can't lil' boy me

[Pre-Chorus]
Had some dirt off in my diamonds, had to brush it off
I was 'posed to be somewhere workin', I'm somewhere fuckin' off
I get checks in by the contract like I'm playin' ball
I been hanging 'round some millionaires, it's safe to say it's rubbin' off
[Chorus]
Tired of this car, then switch it (Switch up)
Tired of my ho, new bitch me (Please)
At this point, this shit pimpin' (Pimpin')
Never off, be consistent (Huh)
Glock two-three extension (Bah-bah)
Handle the business, don't mention
I ain't even have a pot to piss in
Now I got 'em mad, I'm turnin' livid
Tired of this car, then switch it (Switch up)
Tired of my ho, new bitch me (Please)
At this point, this shit pimpin' (Pimpin')
Never off, be consistent (Huh)
Glock two-three extension (Bah-bah)
Handle the business, don't mention
I ain't even have a pot to piss in
Now I got 'em mad, I'm turnin' livid

Yeah, everybody with me got motion, duh
Moshpit, Baby, open it up (Yeah, yeah)
Five in the morning, open the club (Let's go)
Ran out of ones, so I'm throwin' a dub (Fuckin' it up)
Clean as a whistle, straight from the mud (Real mud)
She know she a dime, but I treat her like a dub
Went around the world, all I needed was a buzz (Oh, yeah)
Tryna hang with us, you gon' have to have a plug
Question of the day, do I still sell drugs? (Do what?)
Yeah-yeah, motherfucker, what you want? Pull up
I done had the baddest of the baddest put up (Okay)
Every time I take a picture, throw the hood up (On God)
Every time it time to handle business, stood up (Stacked)
Nigga think he runnin' off with mine, good luck
She know she the one, but I barely even call (Yeah)
Fake good bitch, so I treat her like a dog
All fly shit, you won't catch her in the mall
Real dream team, each set huggin' ball
Twenty foreign cars, I ain't never gotta walk
Billion dollar lawyer, I ain't never gotta talk
Streets love me, ain't never fallin' off
Bought a Cartier bracelet, she don't never take 'em off
[Chorus]
Claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife (Ooh)
You ain't nothin' to a real hitter, fuck your life (Lil' boy)
All she want, a young nigga to fuck her right (Oh, yeah)
Middle fingers in the air, fuck ya twice (Oh, yeah)
Middle fingers in the air, fuck ya twice (Oh, yeah)
Middle fingers in the air, fuck ya twice (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, all money and no emotion, yeah (Yes, sir)
"Can't be fucked with," my slogan, yeah (Yes, sir)
Trap house bunkin', that's brodie (That's brodie), yeah
Make another hundred, I'm focused (I'm focused), yeah
Shawty rockin' with me, she a whole pack
White shit, thick like Doja Cat
Fuckin' up the money, you wrong for that (Stupid)
Comin' through trim, we known for that (I do it)
You don't know another nigga like this, I'm him
I ain't fuckin' with these bitches, fell back, they weird
Top tier women, I done had 'em on film (I tried)
My brothers my brothers, I don't got no family (Family)
Ridin' 'round the city with a chop' and a fin
Cross that line, shit, not gon' end (I ain't lyin')
I done T'd up, took my first lil' ten
She was ridin' in the Uber 'til I put her in the Benz (Big dog)
Real livin' legend, I had million dollar spots (You want)
Cocaine water, baking soda in the spot (Whip up)
Whole lot of pounds, we ain't never runnin' out
Goin' Baby land crazy, six thousand a pop (Come trim)
Whole lot of hatin', niggas hopin' that you flop
Ol' broke-ass nigga, you need to go and get a job (Broke)
Knowin' that your bitches start workin' with the cops (Ain't stop)
Talkin' to these bitches, that's the reason he got robbed

Yeah, hundred K light, that's just travel to me (Check, please)
I ain't goin' back and forth, bitch, I'm capital P
Ain't dropped a song when my trap still on beat
We got three thousand pounds, how the fuck we gon' sleep?
Lost a few guys, but I ain't lose no sleep
Ain't no roof on this 'Rari, ain't duckin' no beam (What else?)
I'm the big dog, niggas puppies to me (What?)
That's my shit, but she can't be in public with me
Fuckin' these bitches ain't nothin' to me
I had pretty shit when it was ugly for me (On God)
Real hustler, I am (Am)
I could send a pack all the way to Thailand (Thailand)
He can't do nothin' for you, but I can (I'm him, I can)
Bulletproof, that wherever I land at
In the hood wherе I'm high in demand at (Demand)
Ten wholе summers, no fumbles, I ran that
Pillow talkin' to hoes got your man jacked
All that hidin' in the house got your man stamped
Baby land, we done sold out a WHAM pack (Gone)
Certified, came home servin' 'em gram sacks
"Go be rich or die tryin'," I chance that (Chance it)
I took off, but I still sent a hand back (A hand)
Give the trenches some hope
Put it on like I'm still sellin' dope, the new 'Rari a four door (Four door)
Me and bae on the yacht with some hoes
When we done, call 'em over and go eat at Komodo
In Skyami, I move like a pope now (Keisha)
She a good one, but love to get choked out (Come here)
I make anywhere turn to a dope house

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Hoppin' out a lambchop
Hotter than Atlanta

Whole lot of bands on me, yeah

Track' with the kill switch, all that type shit

Bought a 'Rari, I'm rich, I ain't rent one
I'm on Candler where I get my tint done
If she askin' for money, I send some
Get her hair and her nails, and her hips done
All the trucks be P, we got ten of 'em
When you talk 'bout a real one, I been one
If you point out a opp, I'ma spin one
We give all of 'em belt, nigga, then some
Niggas goin' back and forth, ain't none of that
If she fine and she thick, I'ma double-tap
Put a switch on the back, gotta double-tap
Get him smacked, turn around, give his brother dap
G-block, cutthroat, where they thuggin' at
It's a few rap niggas that'll never rat
I'm one, engineer, this where you cut it at
All the fans and the blogs need to study that
Super Saiyan from the back, I Goku
She a rachet-ass bitch, put her on Zeus
I'm a player, I'll run through the whole crew
Brought Drac' with me and it know kung fu
If I hit him in the jaw, then he gon' sue
Colored diamonds in the Richard like Hi-Chews
She like, "How the car barkin'?" Ain't no roof
When you suck me, I don't wanna feel no tooth
Nigga, fuck your big dog, say you know who
We got sticks for them niggas and smoke too
Need to call the opps vibes, they hoes too
Probably wouldn't step on shit with a old shoe

If she bad and she quiet, I go through
Slow music, she fuckin' me slow too
I'm an R&B nigga off Pro Tools
If it's war with us, you probably gon' lose
From Atlanta, ain't playin' by no rules
Catch him at the red light, nigga, don't snooze
Glock .40, Gen5, nigga, don't move
Bulletproof Maybach, put it on cruise
Take a nigga main bitch, put her on a cruise

Solid

Mmm
Mmm-mmm
Yeah, fuck it, let me pop my shit one time
[Chorus]
Nobody got hit, spin the block again (Yeah, yeah)
I done been too solid, something got to give (Yeah, yeah)
Rockin' real diamonds before I got the deal
Through the grace of God, we got away, so now we gotta chill
They thought it was rap cap and I told ’em that I got a mil'
You can get whatever if you ask me, you ain't gotta steal
My lil’ woadie said he fightin' demons, feel like he gotta kill
And I just left the hood to catch a vibe and that shit give me chills
[Verse 1]
One hand on my steering wheel, other arm to work the blicky
I'ma be forever gang but smart enough to keep my distance
Product of the real trenches, that's why I wear a trench coat
Damn near fucked my life gamblin', bet it all on ten-to-four
Rap get slow, I'm sellin' loads, can't get caught with no skinny ho
Can’t get caught with no ho at all, bitch, don’t slam my door that hard
I pull up like, "Oh my Lawd," she gon' shop, she hold my card
Glock four-fifth my bodyguard, I sip syrup, no noddin’ off
If you know you owe me, better come and pay me, better not be a dollar short
I done took the game, put it in a lock, I ain't even try
Lookin' like a lick, tryna play slick, nigga, you'll die
Comin’ from the bricks, I ain't had shit, now the new Coupe 125
Yeah

[Chorus]
Nobody got hit, spin the block again (Yeah, yeah)
I done been too solid, something got to give (Ah, ah)
Rockin' real diamonds before I got the deal
Through the grace of God, we got away, so now we gotta chill
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Do it for my family, my fans, fuck how niggas feel
Told 'em it was my turn, I'm guessing that time's here
Skeleton my Cartier, makin' sure my time pure
If you were not here when we was thuggin', you can't come 'round here
Hard work, my grind real, I'm dedicated to get this paper
He okay, he's been a hater, I don't know why he mad at me
I won't let the youngins take him off, and now he mad at me
He better be lucky that I ain't out here just bad rappin'
High speed, gettin' in low gear, streets taught me have no fear
I invested in the West, their niggas know I've sold my dope there
Pretty pussy, no hair, she don't like when I put it in my song
So I can't go there, but she know I like to go there
[Chorus]
Nobody got hit, spin the block again (Yeah, yeah)
I done been too solid, something got to give (Yeah, yeah)
Rockin' real diamonds before I got the deal
Through the grace of God, we got away, so now we gotta chill
They thought it was rap cap and I told 'em that I got a mil'
You can get whatever if you ask me, you ain't gotta steal
My lil' woadie said he fightin' demons, feel like he gotta kill

Yeah, mm, mm
Hmm-mm
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: Lil Baby & Rod Wave]
We got pounds all on the counter
In the spot, watchin' the cameras
I ain't never scared to take a risk, I know life is a gamble
Can't believe they turned they back on me
Now my life in shambles
I got money, thought they'd be happy for me
They'd rather see me in shackles
Startin' the gas, I can't go backwards
Fifty mill' a year my average
Used to work that kitchen cabinet
Payin' the block, they used laugh at me (Laugh at me)
Yeah, now I'm what they grab at (Yeah)
Back then, they would laugh at me (Yeah)
Now I'm who they grabbin'
My grandma get whatever she want from me 'cause she ain't gettin' no younger
Niggas actin' like they with you, turn your back, they'll put 'em on ya
Feel like the coldest nigga ever, I got permanent pneumonia
There was times I needed help, I had to do it on my own
I ain't cry, it made me strong
Fuck a nigga, I work my phone
They got jammed when we was younger
For fifteen years, D done been gone
I make sure I handle they lawyer fees
Determined to bring 'em home
They was hopin' they'd take me out
But I had made it through the storm
I'm like shoutout to my cousin, dog, he was right there, ain't even have to call (Uh, I'm a country boy, don't wanna talk for long)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Had to cut my brother off, I can't believe you broke the law (Niggas still sip codeine)
That shit really did somethin' to my head

[Chorus: Rod Wave]
Uh, okay
Got all of this money pilin', Lord, I wanna ball forever
You know I could really use Your help, yeah (Use Your help, yeah)
Thousand on a tractor-trailer, shoutout to my cousin, dog (Yeah)
I couldn't have did it by myself, yeah (Did it by myself, yeah)
Okay, time and time again, I gave you last chances
Love life in the end, at least my pack landed (Yeah)
Thousand on a tractor-trailer, shoutout to my cousin, dog
I couldn't have did it by myself, yeah (Did it by myself)
[Verse 2: Rylo Rodriguez]
Been off the pounds, we built for it, they touchin' the clearport
Lil' broski represented himself
He had beat the feds, he ain't have a lawyer
Soon as we touchin' the airport, we duckin' the task force
Bro said he can't wait 'til he see Alabama like Travis Barker
My opps got security, only 12 I'm rockin' with be Travis Hunter
I had zero, Labaron Philon, now I give allowances to my mama
From the projects to loadin' up a PJ with convicted felons
Since bro snitched on a dead man, he don't think it's tellin'
Can't believe my cousin, dog
Can't believe you took the stand
Can't believe my hood and I
Was a couple niggas, still shook his hand
Wanna make lil' Snoop a highlight tape, thank God he shook the Xans
Had a thousand of 'em on the tractor trailer truck, they sold before they land
Soon as it touch down, hotel trap out of rooms
Shawty want me to pay to get her face beat, Metro Boomin
Postin' weed on your story, you lucky the feds ain't tuned in
Always actin' like you know shit, but you ain't even score shit

I’m Straight
27 ContributorsI’m Straight Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Cook that shit up, Quay
I look up, I see I got bout seven rides in the streets
Know what I'm saying?
Living life to the fullest, you know what I'm saying?
[Chorus]
Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great (I'm straight)
I just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
I sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
So many blue hundreds they stickin' like they counterfeit, I print this shit
Whole lot of ones, I'm in the cut, I'm going dumb-dumb
I'm sippin' act', and that some real deal, do you want some?
Same ones tryin' run with the clique
Be the same ones that throwing salt on the clique
Main reason why I'm fuckin' ya bitch, I ain't gon' say shit
[Verse 1]
I asked you about it, you lied
You asked me about it, I kept it one hundred, I'm nothin' like these other guys
I really spent two thousand on kicks and only wear 'em one time
Something about a nigga mind frame
Diamonds doing jumpin'-jacks in the AP, I can make the time change
Two hundred hoes in my call log and I ain't got not a name saved
Took her out the hood, put her on the drip, now I got her rockin' name brand
Me and Ced had two different spots, we usually around the corner doin' the same thing
Everywhere I go my chains hang, free the bros out the chain gang
New Maybach cost 230, I don't even get my shoes dirty
I don't even sleep when I get tired, you can see the Adderall in my eyes
Tiger said he got the drop on the opps
Fuck it slide and shoot up the block
Niggas know how we come through
G5 out the sunroof

[Chorus]
Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great (I'm straight)
I just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
I sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
So many blue hundreds they stickin' like they counterfeit, I print this shit
Whole lot of ones, I'm in the cut, I'm going dumb-dumb
I'm sippin' act', and that some real deal, do you want some?
Same ones tryin' run with the clique
Be the same ones that throwing salt on the clique
Main reason why I'm fuckin' ya bitch, I ain't gon' say shit
[Verse 2]
We use trap out my mom house, turn the condo to a hideout
We can't be fuckin' at my house, niggas be runnin' they damn mouth
Walk down on them broad daylight, it ain't no fun in no drive-by
I'm cool on the love and the high-fives
You niggas can't keep up with my guys
You can't get all this drip in a lifetime
I got out and ran it up at the right time
We got Dracos whenever it's nighttime
We ain't ever gonna stop at the stop sign
Went to Wafi, I told 'em I want to shine
Then the coupe quarter million, they wiped me down
I'm running this town, everything I say facts niggas can't take that
New Lamborghini 18'
Only thing I do is make cream, I don't why these niggas hating
Only thing I do is drink lean, rest in peace to Fredo Santana
I just keep on buying all these Fantas
I don't want to go out like that, only thing I know is get racks

[Chorus]
Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great (I'm straight)

On a bouncy trap beat produced by Wheezy, both artists make references to each other personal rap groups and… Read More [Intro: Future]
(Wheezy outta here)
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
She sent a sad emoji when I fuck and leave, she say I treat her like a slut
Bae, I can't come to your condo, can’t fit in no parking garage in this big ass truck (Too big bro, damn)
If it was once then it might've been luck, if I did it two times then it stand for something
All my niggas say I'm fuckin’ the game up with all of these bitches, I'm payin' too much
I'm gettin' a lot of money, I ain't trippin'
If I ain't popped the seal, I ain’t sippin’
I paint my Wagon blue, I'm still Crippin’
Hope you know I remember, I ain't forgetful
Give her the world, and she gon' still come to me
Oh, you ain't heard? I’m un-fuckin'-wit'-able
But, boy, you a wankster, you ain't even lit enough
I don't got no involvement but they hit 'em up
Three mill' a year, what my artists make minimum
Look at me, I done built me a business up
Baby JAY-Z, I run me a billy up
Gave her seventy-five hundred, her titties up
It's like ten of us with a Richard Millie
We be turning shit up, you should fuck with us
You can't name a young crew that can fuck with us
Any category, we'll fuck 'em up
From the cars, to jewels, to titles, to deeds, to streets, to beef, whatever, they know it's us
I'm 4 Pockets, I pop out with OTF
We gon' be at the top, you can meet us there
I'm tryna motivate the hood to do better
I lost my coat, and I had to wear two sweaters
I ain't been rich all my life, don't be fooled
I sold them nicks and them dimes at the school
Been a lil' player, knew I was gon' be the one, I'm buyin' all the pretty girls lunch
My mama been knew I was gon' be a problem when in fifth grade I got kicked out for hunchin'
We follow all of the opps on our Finsta
Soon as they post a location, we flip 'em
My niggas takers, I ain't talkin' pictures
They be on bullshit, I can't take 'em with me
Shit ain't all bread and butter, I come from the gutter
Sat in prison a couple of years
I got my shit together, some investment partners
Now I own me a couple of million

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I really paid all cash for that (That's cash), nigga, that's facts
I don't really care, they can stay mad (They mad), nigga, I'm good (I'm good)
All my hitters gon' stay with a bag (Stay with a bag), they know how to jugg (Jugg)
Everybody gettin' straight to it, everybody come from the hood, everybody ain't gon' do it
I really paid all cash for that (That's cash), nigga, that's facts
I don't really care, they can stay mad (They mad), nigga, I'm good (I'm good)
All my hitters gon' stay with a bag (Stay with a bag), they know how to jugg (Jugg)
Everybody gettin' straight to it, everybody come from the hood, everybody ain't gon' do it
[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I just fuck too many bitches, I only gave one of 'em money, she might want a Bentley or somethin'
A real one, I still gave her hits even though she was fuckin' on Gunna
I done gave lawyers to niggas who really be dissin', but fuck it, them niggas gon' tell if it's fuck 'em
And it's some bitches I'm hittin', I'm thinkin' I'm lit, but in reality I can't duck 'em
Check my net worth, hundred-fifty cash on the pay worth, Google better change my net worth
I paid three-million cash for all the cars I got, pink slip come through the mail though
I done spent money in all the stores, I need to call Dior
I been 300 before he was claimin' 300, I could've signed Lyor
Rappers slick, tryna pull up to my sessions, they tryna find they whores
Bronem takin' every Glock they see, what is we buyin' them for?
He say he be hangin' with murderers, I'm with the murderers, so niggas is not who you think
Niggas be plottin' and takin' all shit that you rockin' as soon as you niggas can blink
You not from the mud, if you ain't wash up in the sink
You not from the mud, if you ain't grow up with a Link
It's Only The Family, fuck what you believe, shit, free Lil Steve
I heard niggas say I couldn't come on my block, shit, this shit on my sleeve
I fuck one bitch everybody wanna fuck, had that ho on her knees
I fuck with all the gangsters, and we locked in with the T's

[Chorus: Lil Baby, Lil Baby & Lil Durk]
I really paid all cash for that (That's all cash), nigga, that's facts
I don't really care, they can stay mad (They mad), nigga, I'm good (I'm good)
All my hitters gon' stay with a bag (Stay with a bag), they know how to jugg (Jugg)
Everybody gettin' straight to it, everybody come from the hood, everybody ain't gon' do it
I really paid all cash for that (That's cash), nigga, that's facts
I don't really care, they can stay mad (They mad), nigga, I'm good (I'm good)

Don't get in hatin' shit, I'm on some greatest shit

I didn't have shit, I ain't never get jealous
Born in this shit, I grew up with some felons
Reach for this water, we'll go at your mеlon
My lil' bro a slime, he'll draw on a revеrend

I'm set on servin' in the morning, I'm snappin'
You can take this as your warning, I'm packin'
F.N. inside of my hand when I back in
Get to actin', I promise we clappin'
Joke's up, it gotta be stamped  on the package
It's the real one, you know that I'm taxin'

Don't get in hatin' shit, I'm on some greatest shit
My people proud, I'm as real as it gets
Gon' have to chase me, I don't like to wait
And I swear I'm impatient, I don't like to sit
I made a way for you lil' bitty niggas
I wish you would play with me, boy, you a bitch, yeah
[Verse 2: EST Gee]
All this shit started off in the kitchen (Started off in the kitchen)
Showed me once and I was payin' attention
Ask the trenches, they gon' say I'm the realest (Say I'm the realest)
Official, the difference between me and niggas
I'm rich when I get off my Insta (Get off my Insta)
Get him killed by the night for a sixty
I sent it, I can't even risk it
Opps want me finished but I'm steadily winning
Youngest, richest nigga out of my city
I been had the streets in a headlock (Headlock)
We had two or three bricks at Miss Jan's spot (At Miss Jan's)
Still dead fresh if the feds watch
Send a diss in hidin', get yo' man shot (Get yo' man)
Niggas play but they know we gon' air it out
She was actin' bougie, flew her friend out
I went, took it, ain't ask for a handout
Old niggas see me out, had to put they heads down
I still got my block if the music don't crack
Really livin' what I rap (Yeah, yeah)
250 out the trap, if I say it, it's a fact
You was puttin' on an act
You a killer on the app (Killer on the app)
Ask who put us on the map
Put the hood on my back
Three cars, ten straps
Niggas better never lack, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I been savin' my guala, I ain't savin' no bitch
I had put down my Glock but I picked up a stick
Don't get in hatin' shit, I'm on some greatest shit
My people proud, I'm as real as it gets
Gon' have to chase me, I don't like to wait
And I swear I'm impatient, I don't like to sit

I wish you would play with me, boy, you a bitch, yeah
I been savin' my guala, I ain't savin' no bitch

Got a tan, I let her lay out by the pool, we got plenty
Soon as I lock in, I lock in, if I want it, I'm gon' get it
I'm so hood, nigga, so high-class, my 'Rari truck, I rent 'em
Like I'm paralyzed and my spine broke, can't turn my back on my twin
I'm so D-boy and I stay fresh, went Louis Vuitton on my Timb'
I'm so damn smooth, I snipe shit, I ain't never speakin' on the business
She know she mine when I'm in town, you can have her back when I'm finished

I don't do no young niggas, my youngest ho like thirty-six (On God)
Actin' stingy with the dick, he must don't think that I'm a whore (Huh?)
They did not stop makin' good dick when they made yours (The fuck?)
Better be lucky that I like you 'cause these niggas gettin' ignored
Boy, don't play with me, I get niggas, you like one of four, duh
I don't think about you hoes (No), I just think I'm the shit (On God)
Y'all know any occasion, I walk in, I'm fresher than a bitch (Stamp that)
I ain't beggin' no nigga to stay (The fuck?), I'm quick to let him leave
Yeah, it's a million more bad bitches, but ain't none of them bitches me (On gang)

Never Hating

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Fresh like the first day of school on the weekend
I put this shit on today, for no reason
Got somethin' to smile about, I fixed up my teeth
Straight from the lot, call up Herm, get it geeked up
Thousand horse power, my car gotta keep up
Act like I'm slow all the time, but I peep stuff
What kinda guy let a bitch keep the beef up?
I let 'em live for a while, now the lease up
Nail in the hammer, I done built it from the ground up
Brodie say he workin', but the bricks, them went down somethin'
They handle the business, I do not go around them
You can get a hundred if you want to, we got pound spots
I'm the one that's really havin' motion, what they talkin' 'bout?
Cars, I done did that, chains, don't need no more
So many clothes, startin' to feel like a hobo
Every milestone, tryna buy me a new home
Potholes keep on fuckin' up the Forgi's, take the rims off
The way she twist and suck it, like she tryna take the skin off
Bro'n'em, in a striker, but it’s good, we swapped the VINs out
Don't bark up this tree, I make the chopper knock his limb off
Thousand dollars after every road, that’s what they hittin' for
All I do is fuck her, I done turned her to a nympho
FN's, blackouts, Gen5's, Gen4's
Trippin' for the family, I don’t play about my kin folk

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I took the guys to L.A. for a business meetin'
God, watch my friends, I can handle my enemies
Fuck I look like havin' smoke with my mini-me's?
Niggas gotta be jokin', you kiddin' me?
Y'all real kids, been small-time ballin', now it's real big
I was standin' in the bleachers, on some cheerin' shit
Never been a hater, I don't care enough
This shit ain't gon' stop until they bury us
[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Fresh off the jet, I end up in the projects
See somethin' I like, no police, I'ma cop it
Don’t follow my page, I post racks every day
For these niggas and bitches that's countin' my pockets
Ooh, hurdle this bitch in Huaraches
Lambo', Ferrari, Bentleys, I got options
I took the private jet out to Nevada
4PF CED, they got smoked like a rasta
Trenches with me
Somethin' seem suspicious, somethin' seemin' fishy
I'm four pockets full and look like biscuits
Overprice us and we uppin', uppin'
Fire, fire, fire, fire, that sound sound delicious
You can't use the dishes, in the kitchen cookin'
Woo, woo, litty, can't abort the mission, bitch, I got addictions
I don't do photo, pictures, keep it low and with me, yee

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I took the guys to L.A. for a business meetin'
God, watch my friends, I can handle my enemies
Fuck I look like havin' smoke with my mini-me's?
Niggas gotta be jokin', you kiddin' me?

I can't wait around for nobody, I need it right now
I might buy that car if it make the right sound
Solitaire earrings bling blingin' from a mile away
I can't do what she want me to do, she tryna take my child away
I think my past tryna haunt me (Haunt me)
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me? (From me)
I gotta give it to 'em, if I don't
I might go to the hood, I'll make a song
Turn the trap spot to the studio
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I'm tryna make a way for my folks
Seein' how I'm Oakland City only hope
I gotta get it, I ain't got time to play
Ain't got no time to waste
I've been havin' nightmares about goin' back to jail, so I wake up
Drankin' all this lean, poppin' Adderall so I can stay up
Niggas that I used to love actin' like they're mad 'cause I got my cake up
Ain't gon' never let it get to a nigga, keep on grindin', tryna get another million
Condo on Peachtree, I paid the rent for the closet
They just wanna talk about my past, they don't wanna accept the fact that I'm a boss
Everything I wanted, I'ma go and get it, I ain't trippin' 'bout a cost, yeah
Everybody want a piece of the winnings, they're never there when you're lost
Seen my main man try to cross me, I'm tryna pass it down to my offspring
All these hoes see me flossing, seen my first mil', felt awesome
They can't follow me, I lost 'em
Had to boss up, so I bossed up
Now I'm bossed up

I can't wait around for nobody, I need it right now
I might buy that car if it make the right sound

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
She gotta be piped up to feel my emphasis
She hot, yeah, she sizzlin'
But can't love her more than a studio
Serena and Venus, yeah most of my chains tennis
So I wore it all to the studio (Studio)
My baby mama got pregnant, had to buy a bitch a car to get an abortion
She just wanna see tears and sad faces on my shorty
But I can't get mad, that's the way it go when you're fortunate
Leave a million cash in the street, nigga better not touch it (On God)
Act like they came to lay hands so their trust don't get busted (No cap)
Straight from Mossberg to Hillsborough
Birds, bless the J's on that cizzurb
Ridin' in the Lambo that the lil' kids say "Bingo" to
My last two years were the worst ones in my career, but I'm still rich as you
Disneyland's where your kids go, on a private jet when I'm into you (When I'm into you)
Them lil' bitches that be hatin' need to pipe down (Pipe down)

[Chorus: Lil Baby with Young Thug]
I can't wait around for nobody, I need it right now
I might buy that car if it make the right sound
Solitaire earrings bling blingin' from a mile away
I can't do what she want me to do, she tryna take my child away
I think my past tryna haunt me (Haunt me)
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me? (From me)
I gotta give it to 'em, if I don't

Cook that shit up, Quay
What's the chances that you'd make it from the bottom?
Let's go
[Verse 1]
Gotta beat the odds, I'm tryna blend in (Blend)
Hit that boy so many times, he made CNN
Fear of God pants, I don't fear men
Pull up in an old-school, the fifty in the rear end, big dawg
Takin' chances, gettin' packs, and tryna get 'em back
I watched the law take my bro, I'm tryna get him back
I pray to God that I don't have to get nobody whacked
Ain't gettin' into that, I try to tell 'em facts
[Chorus]
What's the chances that you run you up a couple mil'? (Huh?)
And you really come from sleepin' out the projects
What's the chances that you run you up a couple mil'? (Huh?)
And your two main men catch a body
[Verse 2]
I got it the worstest, I ain't have to rehearse this
Made me who I am, I'm gettin' bands, I'm breakin' curses
Trap spot do six figures, still got sheets for curtains
Excuse me as I go off, have flashbacks in my verses, I'm tellin' you
I done put my heart inside a box and tried to sell it to 'em
Beefin' with my partners, do a nigga like I never knew him
Fucked around and seen her with a nigga, I woulda never knew it
Always talkin' 'bout what I'm gon' do, but I don't ever do it, yeah
Beefin' with myself
Keep pourin' that syrup up, knowin' it don't help (No)
It's like I got money to please everybody else
They act like they with you, but I'm knowin' they don't care
They in it for self (Yeah), I got it for sale if it's rollin' (Rollin')
I got out of jail and I showed 'em (Showed 'em)
Couple bitches know they wish they would've held it down
It feel like they build me up, try to tear me down

[Chorus]
What's the chances that you run you up a couple mil'? (Huh?)
And you really come from sleepin' out the projects
What's the chances that you run you up a couple mil'? (Huh?)
And your two main men catch a body
[Verse 3]
I gotta stay solid
I grew up 'round dope boys, I don't need no stylist
I got grown man money, can't be actin' childish (No childish)
I've been through too much shit, barely even smile (Huh?)
Sippin' on this red, I wish bro was with me now (Now)
It was time that we'll go broke, we'll pick a play and take 'em down
Kick me when I'm down, when I get up, I'll prolly shit on you
I can't even lie, I'll prolly see 'em, I just spit on them
These pieces I got lit on me, this piece I got gon' hit on men
I ain't ever did no fraud, but I'm known for pullin' cards
Ask about me in my neighborhood, I'm known for goin' hard
I've been bustin' on that glizzy ever since I had got robbed (Bah-bah, bah-bah)
I done really beat the odds
[Chorus]
What's the chances that you run you up a couple mil'? (Huh?)
And you really come from sleepin' out the projects
What's the chances that you run you up a couple mil'? (Huh?)
And your two main men catch a body
What's the chances that you run you up a couple mil'? (Huh?)
And you really come from sleepin' out the projects
What's the chances that you run you up a couple mil'? (Huh?)
And your two main men catch a body

I cut the bitch, she couldn't play her role, ya dig?
A couple million plus I spent on clothes, ya dig?
Bitch actin' like she scared, I bought her a Ghost, ya dig? (Boom)
These lame-ass rappers tryna see if I fucked they bitch, you know I did (You know what I did)
Got three hundred pounds in the spot and they all disappeared, you know where they went (What?)
Ain't worried about a ho tellin' her best friend I'm cheap, she know I'm rich (Know)
Got four-five hoes on a jet and it's only me, you know I'm lit (Yeah)
I'm a hot head but my heart cold, that bitch just won't unthaw
I done ran it up, I ain't goin' broke, that shit ain't in my thoughts
I'm a real player, if you play it wrong, you can't keep the shit that I bought
Got white girl like Mary Jane, trap swingin' like Peter Parker
Can't blame him, that's my son, he just doin' the shit I taught him
On Rodeo in a Maybach, they think that that's Rick Ross
Wanna fuck me, she a broke bitch, sorry, boo, that's a big, "Hell nah"
Wanna sneak diss, it's cool though, but your ass better not get caught (Fa, fa, fa, fa, fa)

Got fifties, thirties, switches, every pole, ya dig? (Dig)
Brand new money, blue notes fallin' out my clothes, ya dig? (Dig)

These lame-ass niggas get dropped from left and right, you know I did it (Alright)
When she put her hair in a bun and grab my belt, I'ma know it's real (Ooh)

He rap about opps, but ain't put them hoes down, he silly (Haha)

I'm fuckin' his bitch and talkin' about it in my raps, he gon' kill me (What?)
I'm walkin' a check, got six-fifty on each leg, ya dig? (Yeah)
Dollar Faygo, now it's worth a band, ya dig? (Ooh)
Amiri flannel blue, I'm dressed like Craig, ya dig? (Ooh)
Just like Simon, bitch, better do what I say, ya dig?
I go to the club with it on me, I seen niggas die tryna run to the whip, yeah
My life is a movie like Paid in Full, my uncles, they hate that I'm rich, yeah
I might go to hell, I'll ice skate with the devil before I put faith in a bitch
I fucked her so good, she ain't ask for the money, I was 'posed to be payin' her rent
I'm givin' the blicks to the shorties for free, but they only get paid for a hit
I'm capital P, how I'm peelin' these pints and paintin' these pops like Prince, yeah
It come out the wrapper, it shine and glisten, it look like the flake of a fish
The way I was kickin' my pimpin', a regular nigga, he can't even dig (Damn)
I done dressed up all my cups, look like Suge Knight, you know they red
My Glock so switched, it went from Kris to Caitlyn, you know it's trans

[Verse 3: 42 Dugg]
I'd rather chase that check, that bag, stash nine Ms over 1.5
Damn right, I got a dime, they don't see me
I was probably wearin' True's before Chief Keef
Drop a five in the Sprite, bitch, pink, pink (Yeah)
If I knock a bitch down, hear, "Ding, ding"

Oh they doin' that, I did it first
Fuck you give me ten for a verse

Fuck her good, buy that bitch a purse
Eat the pussy, blame it on the perc

Still sendin' packs to the prison
Run the money all the way up, wonderful feeling
Bust down Rollies came from scratch
Catch a nigga slipping, do him bad
Take a nigga's shit, won't give it back
Half a bag, get a nigga whacked
Wreck the Masi, go and get a Jag
Hellcat goin' real fast
Fuck 12, I ain't goin' back
Do it for the shit I never had
Niggas droppin' salt 'cause they mad
They don't wanna see me with a bag

We got London On Da Track
You was faking it all along
Felt that shit inside my bone
Had a feeling you had told
When I felt it in my soul
And you know your word ain't strong
'Cause they know you getting old
Ever since I been on
We give the trenches hope
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, keep it a buck, it ain't nobody fucking with us
I can't sit 'round and talk about other niggas
That shit old, I don't care what he did
We was cool, but it is what it is now
Broke as fuck, used to live at my man's house
I work hard, they ain't give me no handouts
Bro ain't really a opp, he just fanned out
Came with me, we just slept on the same couch
How you play like it's fuck me thеn come back and switch up and ask me for something with thе same mouth?
We have spots in the hood, make sure everyone good
Beat that bitch for too much then we change out
We could be anywhere, we gon' bang out
If you see me, they pay me, I don't hang out
I got too many cars, need a bigger garage
Call the realtor, tell her to change house
This shit deep, I take care of my kids' side of they family
I'm too rich to let somebody handle me
Nah, for real, I pay rent for my young niggas' mama'nem
We got away on the chase, I was one of them
Pay attention to me, you could run it up
I ain't drove it in weeks, gotta warm it up
You gon' D-I-E if you come at us
Got a Richard Mille, it's a one-of-one
I was stuck on the block, ain't have nothing coming in
Every time I fell, I got back up again
I'm gon' practice 'til I fucking win
We ain't brothers, I don't call you niggas twin
Got the hittas trailing me inside a Benz
Everything I got on, I'm tryna times ten
And I don't fuck with y'all niggas, I ain't friendly

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I kept it real with you, why would you lie to me?
You complaining, and you don't even gotta be
I'ma turn up for everyone watching me
I'm on point with this shit 'cause I gotta be
I ain't tripping, I just wanna live good
Would have gave you my all, probably still would
When I can't get no drank, I don't feel good
Been all over the world, but I'm still hood
[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I wasn't born with a silver spoon
You ask me for drugs, and can't get 'em gone
My uncle want drugs, I'll give it to him
He thinking he me when I put him on
Auntie fucking in the bedroom
I had to sleep inside a nigga bathroom
Putting duct tape on the air mattress, so the air wouldn't really leave from
Real niggas on standby, all that fake love, I don't need none
I don't really talk cash with a bitch unless the bitch really need some
One nigga told me he started with dimes and nicks, he say he gon' die with a brick
One nigga told me forever gon' carry his gun, that nigga died with his stick
I grew up, a little bit different, and my uncle had cancer, I had to share a room with a junkie
I told you, I grew up the toughest, came from nothing, had to wash up with a bucket
Police had told me slow down when I be in the city 'cause they say I'm starting a ruckus
Fucked the bitch then give the bitch a Plan B, and tell her this shit come with my money

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I kept it real with you, why would you lie to me?
You complaining, and you don't even gotta be
I'ma turn up for everyone watching me
I'm on point with this shit 'cause I gotta be
I ain't tripping, I just wanna live good
Would have gave you my all, probably still would
When I can't get no drank, I don't feel good
Been all over the world, but I'm still hood
[Outro: Lil Baby]
Felt that shit inside my bone
And you know your word ain't strong
'Cause they know you getting old
We got London on the track
