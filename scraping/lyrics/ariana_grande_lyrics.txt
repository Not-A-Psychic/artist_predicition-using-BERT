One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost

Completely focused, my mind is open

Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing

Mm-mm
[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Last night, boy, I met you, yeah
When I was asleep ('Sleep)
You're such a dream to me, mm, woah
And it was on a day like this, yeah
If you can believe, if you can believe (If you can believe)
Mm, you're such a dream to me
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up
Wake up (Oh), wake up, wake up
Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
"Excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch 'em other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like, "I love you—," who starts a conversation like that? Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? (Is this real?)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up
Wake up (Oh, no), wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mm, boy
[Verse 3: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, "What happened? Why you?"
But when I see you in my dreams, shh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)
The Good Housekeeping Seal
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it (Ooh, hey)

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up

This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind
[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A
[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space

Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you

Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under

About the track… Read More [Intro]
You can feel it, feel it
(Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 1]
They say my system is overloaded
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
I'm too much in my head, did you notice? Mm-mm
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
My body's here on Earth, but I'm floatin'
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down; Down)
Disconnected, so sometimes, I feel frozen and alone
[Chorus]
This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't no time to deny it (Yeah), that is why we talking about it (Get better)
Yeah, we talking about it (Get better, get better)
To deal with it, don't try to get by it (Get better, get better)
Ain't no time to deny it (Get better, get better)
So we had to sit down and just write it (Get better)
[Verse 2]
Want you to get better (Woo!)
My life is so controlled by the what-ifs
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
Is there anybody else whose mind does this, mm-mm?
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
Down, down, down, down
Is there such a ladder to get above this? (Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
(Down, down, down, down)
Maybe I should ground myself where the mud is (Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
Before I'm gone

[Chorus]
This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body (Uh-huh; Yuh, yuh)
Ain't no time to deny it (Yuh; Oh, yeah), that is why we talking about it (Yuh, yuh; Baby)
(Get better)
Yeah, we talking about it (Get better, get better)
To deal with it, don't try to get by it (Get better, get better; Ooh)
Ain't no time to deny it (Get better, get better; Yeah)
So we had to sit down and just write it (Get better)

It take you and me to make us (Yeah)
One of those days you had enough (Yeah), I'll be there (Yeah, yuh, yuh, yuh)

When you need someone to pull you out the bubble (Out the bubble)
I'll be right there just to hug you (Just to hug you), I'll be there (Yuh, yuh, hey)
Where are you? Are you home? (Where are you? Are you home?)
Call me right on the phone (Call me right on the phone)
I'll be there (Ayy, sheesh), yeah, I'll be there (Yuh, yuh)
I don't care who is gone (I don't care who is gone), you shouldn't be alone (You shouldn't be alone)
I'll be there (Mm-mm), there

You can work your way to the top (Woo!) (You can feel it, feel it, woo)
(I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, just call me, I'm with you, I'm with you)
Just know that there's up and downs and there's drops (You can feel it, feel it, babe)

Feeling Christmas all around

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

'Cause I got you, girl, let me help you through it
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it (You can see right through it)
I can love you harder than I did before
Was in a dark place back then
I was toxic, then I was toxic to someone else
I was haunted by the hills (Oh yeah, yeah)
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms (Your arms)
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table

The sun is setting and you're right here by my side
And the movie is playing, but we won't be watching tonight
Every look (Every look), every touch (Every touch)
Makes me wanna give you my heart (Ooh-ooh)
I be crushin' on you, baby (Ooh)
Stay right where you are, 'cause
[Chorus]
I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight
[Verse 2]
I kiss his fingertips as I'm wishing he's all mine
He's giving me Elvis with some James Dean in his eyes
Puts his lips (Puts his lips) on my neck (On my neck)
Makes me wanna give him my body (Ooh-ooh)
I be fallin' for you, baby (Ooh)
And I just can't stop, 'cause
[Chorus]
I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight
Baby, I be fallin'
You're my moonlight, moonlight

[Outro]
He's so bossy, he makes me dance
Tryna sit in the back of his whip and just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy, but he's such a man
He knows just what it does when he's holding me tight
And he calls me "Moonlight" too

And I, I take full accountability for all these tears
Promise you, I'm not usually like this
Shit, it's like news to me, to me

I left my heart at a pub in Hampstead
And I misplaced my mind in a good way
Threw away my reputation, but saved us more heartache
Yes, I know it seems fucked up and you're right
But quite frankly, you’re still wrong about everything
So far off, your seat's nowhere near the table
But I find something sweet in your peculiar behavior
'Cause I think to be so dumb must be nice
I do, I do, I do, I do
[Pre-Chorus]
What makes you think you’re even invited?
The doors are closed with lights off inside and all the while
Therе's no one home, you're still outsidе
I wonder why

What's wrong with a little bit of poison? Tell me
I would rather feel everything than nothing every time
Ooh, fear me, stranger, a little bit of sugar, danger
I'd rather be seen and alive than dying by your point of view
I do, I do, I do, I do
[Verse 2]
I don't remember too much of the last year
But I knew who I was when I got here
'Cause I'm still the same but only entirely different
And my lover’s just some lines in some songs, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you’ve read the book I'm still writing
I can’t imagine wanting so badly to be right
Guess I'm forever on your mind
I wonder why

What's wrong with a little bit of poison? Tell me (Tell me)
I would rather feel everything than nothing every time (Every, every time)
Ooh, fear me, stranger (Stranger), a little bit of sugar (Sugar), danger (Danger)

Rather be swimming with you than drowning in a crowded room

But in time, our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later, we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows, oh
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart (Ah)
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough (Ah)
[Verse 2: Nathan Sykes & Ariana Grande]
If I could change the world overnight (Ah)
There'd be no such thing as goodbye (Ah)
You'd be standing right where you were (Ah)
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh (Ah)

Almost, almost is never enough

And we almost, we almost knew what love was

Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?

Break up, make up, total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind? (Yeah, yeah)

Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets (Swerve)
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up (Hold up), I know love can be a beach with no shore (Shore)
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four (Four)
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest (Oddest) couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just bein' honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had

I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny, I really miss it
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us
[Chorus]
He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
But now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything
[Verse 2]
I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're traveling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
And I know "sorry" ain't the cure
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are

[Chorus]
You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
You are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything
[Outro]
Ooh, mm-ah, yeah
You are, you are, you are, ooh
You are, you are, you are
My everything

Uh
[Verse 1]
How can I tell if I'm in the right relationship?
Aren't you really s'posed to know that shit?
Feel it in your bones and own that shit? I don't know
Then I had this interaction I've been thinkin' 'bout for like five weeks
Wonder if he's thinkin' 'bout it too and smiling
Wonder if he knows that that's been what's inspirin' me
Wonder if he's judgin' me like I am right now
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care
I'd rather tell the truth (Truth)
Than make it worse for you, mm (You)
[Chorus]
If the sun refused to shine
Baby, would I still be your lover?
Would you want me there?
If the moon went dark tonight
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would I be the one on your mind, your mind, your mind?
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would you be the one on mine?

[Verse 2]
Please, pay me no mind
While I jump into your skin and change your eyes
So you see things through mine (Through mine, through mine, through mine, through mine)
Can't you sense me? I've been right here all this time (All this time)
Would you still be here pretending you still like me? (Would you still be?)
Pretending you don't regret not thinking before asking
Now you're long gone in Cali (Now you're long)
And me, I'm still unpacking (Still unpacking)
Why I even allowed you on the flight
[Outro]
I broke your heart because you broke mine (I broke your heart)
So me, I am the bad guy (I am the bad guy)
'Cause I'd already grieved you
And you started to realize
I do need ya, I did (Mm)
I wish I could un-need ya, so I did

past life

Woke up with a ghost by my side
Kissed by the passing of time, time
A moth to a flame, I didn't think, I just flew
I just didn't wanna change my mind, mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Rhythms of the night consume my body
Just let the music confiscate my soul
You think I'm lost, but that's just how you found me
Well, maybe I'm the stranger after all

Always wondered what would happen if I let you lose me
Always wondered what would happen if I let myself need more
Might fuck around and elevate my expectations
Now I'm (I'm), fine (Fine), to leave you in a past life
Yeah, I'm (I'm), fine (Fine), to leave you in a past life

Phased me just like the moon
I used to think you were the medicine, but you were just code blue
And you're thinking it too and I already knew (Knew)
I just didn't wanna waste more time

You know? It-it's very easy
And as I told her, never go to bed without kissin' goodnight
That's the worst thing to do, don't ever, ever do that
And if you can't, and if you don't feel comfortable doing it
You're in the wrong place, get out

Elphaba, Glinda
Elphaba, Glinda
I'm a witch, and I'm a witch
But, which is which? Well, here's the sitch
We were roommates back at school
Elphie's awkward, Glinda's cool
We were strangers, that's no lie
But now we're besties, ride or die
The school we go to, it's called Shiz
I study hard for every quiz
While Glinda chases boys with rizz
But, one day, we'll both meet the The Wiz
Green, pink, green, pink
Green, pink, stop
This song's good, kind of a bop
Green, pink, green, pink
Green, pink, pause
No better team in all of Oz
B-F-F's, you know it, bet
We'll tell the haters, "Say less"
Good one, thank you
That was great, not as great as my roommate
Elphie, Glinda
Wanna kick it? Let's go fly
Now, that'd be wicked
