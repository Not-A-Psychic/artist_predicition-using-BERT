Hahahahaha
Tank God
Ayy, ayy
[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)
[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas

And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow)
[Verse 2: 21 Savage & Post Malone]
I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra (No bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, "¡No más!" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like, "Savage, why you got a twelve car garage
And you only got six cars?" (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (Kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (Big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (Old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin', "Where the coke at?" (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar (Ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone & 21 Savage]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies

Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael

Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Woah, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (Hey)

Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans, though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they're matching with the jewelry

Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt, I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck
Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my mama
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas
[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands, I just wanna go

Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex

Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs somethin' to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say (Say)
[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes
[Verse 2: Post Malone]
We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it (Got it)
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted (Wanted)
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head (Head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)

I want you out of my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My heart get possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watchin' the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered (Yeah)
And I don't want ya to never go outside (Outside)
I promise if they play, my niggas slidin' (Slidin')
I'm fuckin' her, and the tour bus still ridin' (Ridin')

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone
[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home
[Verse 2]
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse to tell herself that she okay
It seem like dyin' young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle, blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go home

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home

Feeling Whitney

I've been looking for someone
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep it pouring
And I ain't seen the light of day since, well, that's not important, it's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winnin', you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done
[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had eighty beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more
[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

Never know when someone come and try to take my life
I've been sleepin' with the .45 like every night
In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got "Malone" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'

Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you
More people wanna be you, don't trust no one

A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden
Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in

If you try to pull up to my place

I promise, one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky

Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah
Minute after minute, never had a limit
Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it
Windows always tinted, you ain't lookin' in it
Either way, I know they'll come for me again

Had a wild hair of your own or two?
Livin' in your big glass house with a view

You thought I'd take the blame for us a-crumbling
Go 'round like you ain't guilty of somethin'
Already lost the game that you been runnin'
Guess it's catchin' up to you, huh
You think that you're so innocent
After all the shit you did
I ain't an angel, you ain't heaven-sent
Can't wash our hands of this

It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself

Yeah, you'd die for me
Said you'd die, said you'd die
But you lied, you lied to me
[Chorus: Post Malone]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me

Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

It was love at first sight, felt like you were chosen (Oh)
But that blood in your veins, yeah, I know it's frozen (It's so cold)
Got no patience no more (No), been waitin' too long (Yeah)
You hid that shit away and I was the last one to know, bitch (Ayy, ooh)
I heard you comin' in, I was lyin' there awake (Awake)
Didn't know that it was you, got the gun right out the safe (Damn)
Remember when you got my ass arrested (Wow)
At least when I was in jail, I got some rest in (Yeah)
Ooh, I surrender (Ayy), time to forget ya (Ayy)

[Verse 2: Future]
It was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights (Yeah)
9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight (Daylight)
Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need, ayy (That ain't what I need)
You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (Sold your soul)
From your passport, it looks like you lying (Know you cold)
You broken down by your past, don't deny it (You know I know)
Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah (Flying)
Wasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying (I was trying on ya)
I did everything to reach out to you (I was reaching out)

But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 3: Halsey]
Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold fifteen million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though
[Chorus: Post Malone & Halsey, Halsey]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)

Body for a body, I’m so petty

We can't be friends, can't be family (Oh)

Oh, you belong to the world now
So just leave me alone now
We're not in touch no more

Take me right to you
One hundred bottles of the good shit couldn't even bring you back
What am I to do?
Feel like I'm circlin' a drain, all I see is the remains of an ugly truth (Of an ugly truth)
One hundred models I could follow all the way to hell and back, but they can't replace you (They can't replace you)

I was puttin' on for you like a jersey
What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me
Never thought that you'd go and do me dirty
Left me in the cold, but on the inside I was burnin'
But that's just the way it goes
Wish that I could have control
Everybody dies alone
(And I ain't dead yet)

[Chorus]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?
[Verse 3]
I'm still waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you (Take me right to you)
One hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back
What am I to do? (What am I to do?)
You’re my alibi and motive when I'm lyin' to myself, what an ugly truth (What an ugly truth)
We’re no strangers to the flame
We will never be the same if we make it through (And we can make it through)
[Verse 4]
My back is up against the wall
But I used to feel invincible
Yeah, it was us against the world
But somehow, someway, the tables turned
I remember back then
Played my cards right you were my best hand
Still you keep me guessin'
Wonder if I'll ever get the message

[Chorus]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?

Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Ooh)
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Damn)
Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Ooh)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad
[Verse 1: Post Malone]
They said I would never get this far, ah, ah
Think that we don't see who you are, are, are?
Laughin' to the bank like ha, ha, ha
Guess that I'm just talkin' too much blah, blah, blah (Shut the fuck up)
So, where did y'all go? (Ooh)
When I was shit broke, couldn't even buy smokes
Now your mama needs tickets to my stadium show (Stadium show)
She love it when she hear me on the radio, oh
I know it's hard to swallow your pride
Sorry that you can't get over me (Over me)
Now you're out my life, I'm so relieved, I
[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Damn)

Close to my enemies (Let's go)
I need better energy (Huh?)
When I told you fuck you, you thought I was playin', huh?
(Yeah, yeah) But I meant the shit literally
She want to vibe but I told her fuck that (Nope)
She looking at me like she surprised
They're packin' the post and I'm home alone
When the box hit the door, they go for 35
I try to put on for my partners, they turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em
'Cause most of these niggas are deceiving
And I (Ooh)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Damn)
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Ooh)

I got so many hits, can’t remember them all (Ooh)
While I'm takin’ a shit, look at the plaques on the wall
Y'all just sit back, get your kick back
Keep on actin' like you did that, got no respect
For nobody who's just fake in life, ayy, ayy
You ain’t really who you say you are
So pick up the pace, there ain't no slowin' me up (Slowin' me up)
Get the fuck out my face, can you stop blowing me up?
'Cause my time is expensive, one mill a setlist
Bought a new car 'fore you woke up for breakfast, yeah

You ain't my day one and I know you not my friend

Like you really down with me, because bein' loyal starts within
I seen that money overpower that love and turn it thin
But it ain't stop me, I just kept goin' up, took it on the chin

Fuck around and be as rich as Jeff Bezos, say it again
Never lose, I go overtime on 'em, stay in that gym
Let's get it
[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never

Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I'm tired of bein' tired
This my last shot, you can't be mad, at least I tried
We supposed to be grown, but yet you still acting childish
I can get on the jet alone, I don't need no extra baggage
This year turned into a savage, I got baguettes in my necklace
Driving fast and I won't crash it and I'm supposed to be sober
But some kind of way, I just keep getting loaded
It's gonna take more than some pressure to fold me
Tried as hard as I can, but at this point it's outta my hands
I ain't runnin' out of these bands for nothin' or no one
She say I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one
Been goin' hard, been by myself, I don't need no love
[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

Now all these people wanna keep on takin' pieces of me
They take away everything, had everything that I needed
They held me down, let me drown
They spit me out, right through the teeth
I can't pretend, ash in the wind, won't blow again

These hurricanes inside of my brain, let it rain, made it look easy Can't look away, you love the pain, you love the pain

You cut me down on my knees

Every day's the same, yeah, I just watch 'em go
As I scrape away through the impossible

They hit the ceilin', but my roof likes space
I took my chances so won't you

Pass me them drugs, motherfucker, let me try 'em
At the White House, call my homie Joe Biden, he flyin' out weed
Smokin' my dope, Bathing Ape, that be the clothes

Feel like Meek Milly, but I ain't from Philly
I'm poppin' a wheelie, I show off my grilly
I do this for realy and for my family
Same shit every night, man, it's all so famil'-y
The bitches, they killin' me

Like you got me figured out
[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
But, girl, what I can promise is I'll let you down
So don't put up a fight
You'll get lost in the light
[Chorus: Post Malone]
If you keep staring at the sun, you won't see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance, I will
Fuck up again, I warned
You in advance
But you just keep on starin' at the sun

[Verse 2: SZA]
Wait (Yeah, yeah, wait)
I know I got a lot of shit going on with me (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Now we're free to loving anyone other than me
I try to rewind, I get reminded that time don't wait for nobody
Can't get too close and don't let it go
[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
'Cause I can count on you to let me down
I won't put up a fight
I got lost in the light (Oh)
[Chorus: Post Malone & SZA]
If you keep staring at the sun, you won't see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance, I will
Fuck up again, I warned
You in advance
But you just keep on starin' at the sun
[Bridge: Post Malone, SZA & Both]
Wait
Got a couple little things I would like to say (Oh yeah)
Today is not your day
You should walk away (Oh yeah)
But you won't listen, you just keep on (Oh yeah)

[Chorus: Post Malone & SZA]
Staring at the sun, you won't see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance, I will
Fuck up again, I warned
You in advance
But you just keep on starin' at the sun

Yours

I don't know who you are
But one day, I'm goin' to
And it's gonna break my heart
When she gives hers to you
And it won't be tomorrow
But it's gonna be too soon
When I walk her down that aisle and do what daddies have to do
[Chorus]
And she might be wearin' white
But her first dress, it was pink
She might be your better half
Yeah, but she's my everything
We'll both love her forever
But I loved her long before
And one day, I know I'll give her away
Buddy, that don't mean she's yours
Mm
[Verse 2]
Yesterday, she said her first word
She's a long way from "I do"
Right now she runs to me
One day, she'll run to you
And it's gonna be your best day
But it's gonna be my worst
You might watch her walkin' towards you, but I saw her walkin' first

And she might be wearin' white
But her first dress, it was pink
She might be your better half
Yeah, but she's my everything
We'll both love her forever

And one day, I know I'll give her away
Buddy, that don't mean she's yours

'Cause she's still my little girl
It's crazy thinkin' one day, she'll be someone else's world

You know, when I go in, it's lights out (It's lights out)

Some went away
Why'd you have to go and fucking ruin my day?

You're the reason why I got my ass kicked
But you're the only way to drown my sadness
This is my love/hate letter out to alcohol
You're the reason why I got my ass kicked

I was laid out flat like a centerfold (Centerfold)
Jakey and his partner drove me home
Lookin' in the mirror, something's wrong
Lеt me get my dentist on thе phone (On the phone)
Found my keys, then I went back out
Someone asked me how it all went down
I remember like it's yesterday (Like it's yesterday)
I took a shot, took a shot, took a shot, took another shot
Fell right out my fuckin' chair, swingin' for his eye
Then a big chrome ring flew in from the side
I thought I died
Why'd you have to go and fuckin' ruin my night?

You're the reason why I got my ass kicked
But you're the only way to drown my sadness

Wrapped Around Your Finger

You keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
I was caught up in your orbit, spinnin' like a bullet
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth
[Verse 1]
I can’t call you right now, I been drinking
And I know that I'll say what I'm thinking
My whole life I was drawn to the deep end
When will it sink in?
Why do I tell myself that I’ll do the best I can?
I know damn well that you couldn't give a damn
Ten billion cuties that think I'm the man
But if you come around, I'll be eatin' out your hand

Keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
I was caught up in your orbit, spinnin' like a bullet
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)
I keep wondering who's thе one replacing me?
Takе me back to yesterday
When I was wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
Then was shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)

[Verse 2]
When we met, you ain't know I was a singer
You weren’t impressed by all the ice on my fingers (So icy)
I had your mom and daddy’s house on my pinky (My pinky)
If I'da known what it’d be like now
I wouldn't be in misery right now
Look in the mirror, I don't see myself
Being with me has gotta be like hell
So tell the devil I'ma be right down

I keep wondering who's the one replacing me? (Oh)
Take me back to yesterday
When I was wrapped around your finger

Then was shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)

Threw my bottle at the sky, said, "God, that's a warning"

Try to keep it inside, but I just wanna pour it

I just left Wally's, spent a Maserati
The way I gotta flex, you'd think I did Pilates
I call my quote-unquote friends, "Do you got plans?"
Turns out everyone's free when the dinner is
Then they drag me to a party out in Malibu
After thirty High Noons, it was pretty cool
Tried to shoot my shot, she told me that she had a shoot
Bye-bye (Damn)

The sun is killin' my buzz, that's why they call it mourning

Stumblin' down the corridor, came across an open door
Throwin' up is easy and who put on the Commodores?
That's a nice tile floor, wish I got to know you more
Who am I talkin' to? Nobody
Take me outside, I'm a little too high
Paid a little too much for the time of my life
When money ain't a problem, everyone's lyin'

Prada on my dick, Prada on my sleeve
Give me somethin', somethin' real (Yeah)

Still at it, sign-another-deal addict (Ah-ah, ahh)

So give me one more round (Oh-oh-oh)
No cover fee at the gates of hell, no VIP

Light a cigarette just so I can breathe
Give me somethin', somethin' real (Yeah)
How much psilocybin can a human eat?
Give me somethin' I can feel (Yeah)
Whiskey lullaby just to fall asleep
Give me somethin', somethin' real (Yeah)
And it's what I want, it ain't what I need
Give me somethin' I can feel (Yeah, ooh)
Got everything, guess I'm hard to please
Give me somethin', somethin' real (Yeah, ooh)
I would trade my life just to be at peace

Give me somethin' I can feel (Ahh, ooh)
Give me somethin', somethin' real

Homie, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Homie, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Homie, you's a window shopper
At the dealership, tryna get a test drive
Homie, you's a window shopper
You mad as fuck when you see me ride by
[Verse]
Everybody wanna talk shit on the internet
But they ain't understand they see the work I put into it
I'm guessing all this bullshit just come with the benefits
20 years old, 20 carats, my bezel heavy
Doors suicide, they say a word in remembrance
And they just wanna see me fail but dawg, I ain't havin' it
They wanna tear me down and tell you, "Youngin', you can't handle it"
And I'm just here to tell 'em that their shit never happenin'
And I just flew by in a drop-top Porsche
Givenchy swim shorts like I hopped out the pool
Flu game Post, people callin' me the GOAT
People gettin' heated, shit my Rollie still cold
Ayy-ayy-ayy
I got cha-ayy-ayy-ange
Why you even lookin'? You ain't pay-ayy-in'
I'm still loyal what the fuck is y'all sayin'?
Even though my song stuck in your bitch brain

But there's nothin' I can do
I've been lookin' for a girl like you

I'm gonna pout at you until I get my way

But there's nothin' I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool

We made a pact, you'd take me back, always, again
I'm bleedin' out, I need you now, can't let you win
I want it all, I want it all, I push so hard, I break it
My only home went down in smoke
It's bittersweet, I taste it
So, are you lonely? 'Cause I'm healin' slowly
In a moment, your memory is fading on me
Got no expectations now that I'm forsaken
Let's see what I'm made of, find out if I can take it, now

When I'm alone, pretend I'm letting you go
Just tell me who to blame for this
When wakin' up, feels like a punch in the gut
Just tell me, who's to blame for this?
[Verse 2]
All I wanted was a piece of decent on the side (On the side)
When we go to bed, she be creepin' on my side (On my side)
I was drinkin' all day, I let her spend the night
When I took her home, she left somethin' in my ride, in my ride (Damn)
Then my baby found out
Now I'm livin' in a hotel, livin' in a hotel
Ain't that bad, I got room service
Livin' in a hotel, livin' in a hotel
What your life like? Need a lifeline right now
Ninety-nine nights, tryna get my mind right now
Life is sour, even when I'm in the limelight now
But I try somehow

When I'm alone, pretend I'm letting you go
Just tell me who to blame for this

I can wrap a rope around the moon
Tie it up and drag it down to you
Honey, if you ask me to
You know I'd try it
I can put some diamonds 'round your neck
Dancin' in a ruby-red sunset
Girl, if you don't wanna land this jet
Let's keep on flyin'

Every string, every chord, my guitar
I'll give you everything in the world but my heart

'Cause I gave half to them halfway lovers
I left some to them two drunk summers
Left a piece at the bar with the keys to my car
I know I'm never gettin' it back
I lost a lot to that whiskey-sippin'
I gave the rest to that rockstar-livin'
Take all of me, but thеre's one thang missin'
Baby, I can't give you what don't bеlong to me

Maybe not forever, no, but, baby, for the night
If I knew I'd meet you one day
I woulda never gave it all away

Last-callers, last-chancers

Couple Chucks, Ern's, and Chandler's
With a whole lotta prayers unanswered
Whiskey by noon and beer before that
Southbound train on a hellbound track
Might just put two middle fingers up and throw one back
For all the people who ain't ever felt at home
Just spinnin' on a rock and gettin' stoned

Yeah, this one's for the losers

You might be lonely, but you're never alone
You're right here where you're supposed to be
Right here with all the losers
The ones like you and the ones like me

My therapist is a good bartender

Bad times that we can't forget and
Good times that we won't remember
Raise 'em up when we hear a sad song
Love the cry of a steel guitar

I'm just passin' by
The world keeps gettin' hotter, baby
But I'm too cool to die

She wanna fuck me on a jet, but I'm scared to fly, ah-ah (Fly)
She wanna feed me fancy drinks and keep me up all night, ah-ah-ah (Night)
She asked me if I like this wedding ring
For fuck's sake, it's our first date
I did, and then I went
And bought it on the nеxt date, fits me great, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't mind at all
And I don't cry (I don't cry, don't cry)
Ask mе how I feel
I'm dynamite, and it goes like

But I'm too cool to die (I'm too cool, I'm too cool)
I'm not here for long, my baby (I'm not)

The world keeps gettin' hotter, baby
But I'm too cool to die (I'm too cool to die)

I'm too cool to die

Took a fuckin' sip from my ash can
It didn't bother me too much
I spit another tooth in the trash can
I gave up on keepin' me in touch
[Chorus]
When I go out, it ain't gonna hurt at all
A choir of angels, euthanasia
[Verse 2]
Behold, a sober moment
Too short, and far between
I should crack one open
To celebrate bein' clean
[Chorus]
When I go out, it ain't gonna hurt at all
An end to anger, euthanasia
When I go out, it ain't gonna hurt at all
Familiar stranger, euthanasia

They say it's painless

Wrong Ones

Lift kit on a limousine
I got ten problems down in Tennessee
And I ain't got the time to fix 'em all
Skipped breakfast at Tiffany's
For a little sermon with Bethany
Now I'm sittin' at a bar on 17th, and I'm gone
[Chorus: Post Malone]
With them cold ones comin'
And that smoke fillin' up my lungs
I got fuck-you money
Girl, come on and get you some
And it's hard to walk a straight line
When they curvin' up them jeans
I'm just lookin' for the right one
But them wrong ones keep lookin' at me
[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
Straight outta Louisian'
I'm a bad boy, real good man
Got a six-pack and a farmer's tan, top of the world (Ooh)
I can't help that they wanna glance
Ain't one that don't wanna dance
Bunch of cowboys sayin', "Please don't take thе girl"

[Chorus: Tim McGraw]
Keep them cold ones comin'
And that smoke fillin' up my lungs
I got country monеy
Honey, come on and get you some
And it's hard to walk a straight line
The way they curvin' up them jeans
I'm just lookin' for the right one
But them wrong ones keep lookin' at me
[Outro: Post Malone]
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na

Don’t Understand
36 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsFrançaisEspañolDeutschРусскийItalianoTürkçeDon’t Understand Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm a rolling stone
It took you by surprise
You're hangin' onto something, anything
Just like a shimmer of light
Oh, how the sword, it fell
I said, "You're really something, everything
To me, and I'm cold
So hold me closer, baby"
[Chorus]
I don't understand why you like me so much
'Cause I don't like myself
I don't understand why you like me so much
Wish I was someone else
You say you got a million reasons
But I can't think of one
I don't understand why you like me so much
'Cause I don't like myself, mm-mm

I'll build a church for you
They'll come from miles around
Girl, you're really somеthing, everything
To me, and I'm cold
So hold mе closer, baby

I don't understand how you like me so much

Waiting For Never
45 ContributorsTranslationsPolskiTürkçePortuguêsWaiting For Never Lyrics[Verse 1]
Should've seen the signs, so I guess I deserved it
Made a habit overlookin' cracks in the surface
Goin' along with the bullshit you sold me
What was I to do when the bottle stopped working?
Try to make a home out a house while it's burning down
Burn it to the ground
[Chorus]
Oh, if all these walls could talk
They would tell me, "Sit down, man, shut the fuck up"
You put me through hell but I can't get enough
It took a little while, baby, then I woke up
Woah, when all these tattoos fade
I will never look back, you'll be in thе same place
I keep tellin' mysеlf if I wanted you to change
I'd be waitin' for never, waitin' for never
[Verse 2]
Yeah, you coulda done a better job at hiding your intentions
I know what you did, stop bein' so defensive
Save it, when did you become so jaded?
I'd seen so many come and go, then come back to me
I'll never ever let another take half of me
I can't win, and still, I chase it

[Chorus]
Oh, if all these walls could talk
They would tell me, "Sit down, man, shut the fuck up"
You put me through hell but I can't get enough
It took a little while, baby, then I woke up
Woah, when all these tattoos fade
I will never look back, you'll be in the same place
I keep tellin' myself if I wanted you to change
I'd be waitin' for never, waitin' for never
[Bridge]
Just look right at my face
Yeah, you should stay away
There's nothin' left to fake
There's nothin' left to take
[Chorus]
Oh, if all these walls could talk
They would tell me, "Sit down, man, shut the fuck up" (Shut the fuck up)
You put me through hell but I can't get enough (Can't get enough)
It took a little while, baby, then I woke up
Woah, when all these tattoos fade
I will never look back, you'll be in the same place
I keep tellin' myself if I wanted you to change

Missin’ You Like This
23 ContributorsTranslationsPolskiPortuguêsEspañolMissin’ You Like This Lyrics[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I thought I'd think about you every now and then
When the rain falls down in Kansas, when I hear "Dust in the Wind"
When I told you I was leavin' in that Exxon parking lot
I thought the world would keep on turnin', no one told me it would stop
[Refrain: Post Malone]
And I'da called you crazy after we were through
If you'da told me that it'd take me all my life to get over you
[Chorus: Post Malone]
I knew for a night, girl, I'd be drinkin' 'bout you
But it's years gone by and I'm still dreamin' 'bout you
Cross my heart 'til I die
I swear to God, I woulda never done what I did
If I knew that I'd be missin' you like this
[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
Wake up in the mornin' in a bed with someone new
She don't know I still got pictures in that box instead of boots
You're the whiskey in my coffee, the unanswered in my prayers
You're the reason I'm still lonely, even when the next best thing is layin' right here
[Chorus: Luke Combs]
I knew for a night, girl, I'd be drinkin' 'bout you
But it's years gone by and I'm still dreamin' 'bout you
Cross my heart 'til I die
I swear to God, I woulda never done what I did
If I knew that I'd be missin' you like this

[Refrain: Post Malone & Luke Combs]
I'd have called you crazy after we were through
If you'd have said they'd have to lay me
Six feet under just to get over you

I knew for a night that I'd be drinkin' 'bout you
But it's years gone by and I'm still dreamin' 'bout you
Cross my heart 'til I die
I swear to God, I woulda never done what I did
If I knew that I'd be missin' you like this
[Outro: Post Malone]
I'd be missin' you like this
Missin' you like this

And if I owe you something, I'ma pay it
If you want to say something, then say it
If you want to try the jewels, make my day

[Verse 1]
Woke up in a hot tub, spillin' Moet, in the water
Then I light my marijuana, take a shot up out the choppa
J's jumpin' out the locker, spend a little guapa
She want candy, Aaron Carter
I called her Candy when I saw her
Pull up with my brothers
Candy-painted flyin' saucer
Test me, you'll get flyin' colors

Hunnid bitches comin' up the steps
Turn the front lights on, when I know they on they way
She said she don't wanna do too much drugs
Believe me, baby, I do this shit like every day, like every day
[Chorus]
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it, ayy
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it
(Stoney, Stoney, uh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Wanna talk about them Martins?
Do you wanna talk about them Jordans?
Enjoy a 40 every mornin', Everclear and some recordin'
101, on the 101 like Jeff Gordon
I just popped a pill, she just popped a pill
And we might just pop some more, I ain't stoppin' 'til like 20
Up until like 4, SmartWater like some dummies
Takin' shots up out the semi, that shit kill me like I'm Kenny
[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, bitches walkin' down the steps
Turn the front lights off, got a blunt all to myself
No, I don't want all this shit to get too deep
But listen, baby, there ain't no shit with you and me
No "you and me," no
[Chorus]
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it, ayy
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it
And that's it

2 AM, they ran out of lemonade
So I shot that vodka straight, anyway
She came in, missin' bottle off the shelf
I can't drink this by myself, sit with me, babe
Then I started laughin'
Like it was funny, but it really ain't funny, uh

It's easier to leave me down here on the ground
Take me home, baby, I'm fucked up now

I got a bad bitch that'll bring all her friends
But when I'm with you it's like I'm livin' again

Hide My Gun

Thirty-eight dollars for a coconut rum
You never looked prettier sippin' on one
These downtown lights are turnin’ back off
'Cause the world is turnin' back on
Mm, mm
On the same damn road we drove a thousand times
I swear I saw a message in them white and yellow lines
And I ain’t sayin' I'm a killer or if I'll ever be
But hypothetically
[Chorus: Post Malone]
Would you hide my gun? Would you tell no one?
Would you pack a never-comin'-back-again bag?
If the three-times-four's bangin' at our door
Would you stall and let me slip out the back?
Girl, if you wanted to, could you get to runnin' to
That nevеr-endin’ honeymoon Mexico sun?
’Causе you know I adore ya
No shit, I'd kill a man for ya
And if I did, would you hide my gun?
Would you hide my gun?
[Verse 2: HARDY]
If you had to dig a hole, would you take it to the grave?
Put some concrete shoes at the bottom of the lake?
If I shot him dead, would you shoot me straight?
Yeah, shoot me straight

Would you hide my gun? Would you tell no one?
Would you pack a never-comin’-back-again bag?

Girl, if you wanted to, could you get to runnin' to
A never-endin’ honeymoon Mexico sun?
'Cause you know I adore ya
No shit, I'd kill a man for ya
And if I did, would you hide my gun?
Would you hide my gun?

A big wheel gun in my right hand, tiny diamond in my left
Are you down to go the distance, Lord, in sickness and in health?
Ain't nothin' gonna part us, not even death
[Chorus: Post Malone, Post Malone & HARDY]
Would you hide my gun? Would you tell no one?
Would you pack a never-comin'-back-again bag?
If the three-times-four's bangin' at our door
Would you stall and let me slip out the back?
Girl, if you wanted to, could you get to runnin' to

Nosedive
22 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsEnglishNosedive Lyrics[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I found God lookin' for the devil
Chasin' a high I couldn't keep forever
It's always worse before the better, I suppose
And how far down, it's hard to tell
When to buy and when to sell
'Cause that comedown, it hurts like hell
And every thorn has its rose
[Chorus: Post Malone]
Sometimes you're drivin', sometimes you're stallin'
Sometimes you're flyin', sometimes you're fallin'
But there's still beauty in the nosedive
Sometimes you'rе runnin', sometimes you're crawlin'
Somеtimes you're broke, sometimes you're ballin'
But there's still beauty in the nosedive
[Verse 2: Lainey Wilson]
I hit rock and dropped the shovel
Clawed my way out past the rubble
Do my best, stay outta trouble, heaven knows
Sometimes, the picture, it ain't perfect
But there's learnin' in the hurtin'
Sick of bearin' all the burden
Every thorn has its rose

[Chorus: Post Malone & Lainey Wilson]
Sometimes you're drivin', sometimes you're stallin'
Sometimes you're flyin', sometimes you're fallin'
But there's still beauty in the nosedive
Sometimes you're runnin', sometimes you're crawlin'
Sometimes you're broke, sometimes you're ballin'
But there's still beauty in the nosedive, ah
[Bridge: Post Malone]
On my descent, the turbulence is my best friend
Buckle up and enjoy the ride
I cut my line through pale blue sky
To remind me I'm alive

Sometimes you're drivin', sometimes you're stallin'
Sometimes you're flyin', sometimes you're fallin'
But there's still beauty in the nosedive (Beauty in the nosedive)
Sometimes you're runnin', sometimes you're crawlin'
Sometimes you're broke, sometimes you're ballin'
But there's still beauty in the nosedive
