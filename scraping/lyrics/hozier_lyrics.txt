Take Me to Church
379 ContributorsTranslationsفارسیEspañolFrançaisDeutschNorsk (bokmål / riksmål)ItalianoTürkçeTake Me to Church Lyrics[Verse 1]
My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
[Pre-Chorus]
A, amen
Amen, amen
[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny
Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work
[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen
[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

Too Sweet

It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's 10 o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep tellin' me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby, now and then
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake
Smellin' like a bonfire, lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe, I think it's great
But while in this world
[Chorus]
I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskеy neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for mе
You're too sweet for me

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 2]
I aim low
I aim true, and the ground's where I go
I work late where I'm free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some, I know
But who wants to live forever, babe?
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest of you like you're the TSA
I wish I could go along
Babe, don't get me wrong
[Pre-Chorus]
You know you're bright as the morning, as soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine, as sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel, maybe I'll wait
Until that day
[Chorus]
I'd rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
[Outro]
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me

Work Song

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
[Verse 1]
Boys workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burnin' heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love, I could barely eat
There's nothin' sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
'Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She'd give me toothaches just from kissin' me
[Chorus]
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
[Verse 2]
Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib
And I was burnin' up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear, I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did

[Chorus]
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
[Verse 3]
My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
When I was kissin' on my baby
And she put her love down, soft and sweet
In the low lamplight, I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me
[Chorus]
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

From Eden

Babe
There's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?
Babe
There's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me
[Pre-Chorus]
No tired sigh, no rolling eyes
No irony
No "Who cares?," no vacant stare
No time for me
[Chorus]
Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door
[Verse 2]
Babe
There's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin?
Babe
There's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this
Oh, what a sin

[Pre-Chorus]
To the strand, a picnic planned
For you and me
A rope in hand for your other man
That hang from a tree
[Chorus]
Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Almost (Sweet Music)
86 ContributorsAlmost (Sweet Music) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I came in from the outside, burned out from a joy ride
She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is "Stella by Starlight"
That was my heart, the drums that start off "Night and Day"
[Pre-Chorus]
The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again, she's almost you
[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
[Verse 2]
Tell me who and I'll be thanking them
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek
As soft as Chet can sing "Let's Get Lost"?
And let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper, doll
Blow sweet and thick till every thought of it don't mean a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
I got some colour back, she thinks so too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you
[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
[Bridge]
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't, mmm
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know
[Verse 3]
The very thought of you and am I blue?
A love supreme seems far removed
I get along without you very well some other nights
Oh, the radio news reader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me awake and ask, "Is everything alright?"
And, Lord

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

Someone New

Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electin' strange perfections in any stranger I choose
[Pre-Chorus]
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit

There's an art to life's distraction
To somehow escape the burning wait, the art of scrapin' through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else, I guess any thrill will do

Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit

Let me put my lips to somethin'
Let me wrap my teeth around the world
Start carvin', darlin'
I wanna smell the dinner cookin'
I wanna feel the edges start to burn

Honey, I wanna race you to the table
If you hesitate, the gettin' is gone
I won't lie if there's somethin' to be gained
There's money to be made, whatever's still to come

Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinnin' the children for a war drum
Puttin' food on the table, sellin' bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young
[Instrumental Break]

You can't buy this fineness
Let me see the heat get to you
Let me watch the dressing start to peel
It's a kindness, highness
Crumbs enough for everyone
Old and young are welcome to the meal

Honey, I'm makin' sure the table's made
We can celebrate the good that we've done
I won't lie if there's somethin' still to take
There is ground to break, whatever's still to come

Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young

Unknown / Nth
64 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeУкраїнськаDeutschPortuguêsUnknown / Nth Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know the distance never made a difference to me
I swam a lake of fire, I'd have walked across the floor of any sea
Ignored the vastness between all that can be seen
And all that we believe
So I thought you were like an angel to me
[Verse 2]
Funny how true colours shine in darkness and in secrecy
If there were scarlet flags, they washed out in the mind of mе
Where a blindin' light shone on you еvery night
And either side of my sleep
Where you were held frozen like an angel to me
[Chorus]
It ain't the being alone (Sha-la-la)
It ain't the empty home, baby (Sha-la-la)
You know I'm good on my own (Sha-la-la)
Sha-la-la, baby, you know, it's more the being unknown
So much of the livin', love, is the being unknown
[Verse 3]
You called me "angel" for the first time, my heart leapt from me
You smile now, I can see its pieces still stuck in your teeth
And what's left of it, I listen to it tick
Every tedious beat
Going unknown as any angel to me

[Bridge]
Do you know I could break beneath the weight
Of the goodness, love, I still carry for you?
That I'd walk so far just to take
The injury of finally knowin' you?
[Chorus]
It ain't the being alone (Sha-la-la)
It ain't the empty home, baby (Sha-la-la)
You know I'm good on my own (Sha-la-la)
Sha-la-la, baby, you know, it's more the being unknown
And there are some people, love, who are better unknown

Nina Cried Power
104 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisEspañolDeutschNina Cried Power Lyrics[Verse 1: Hozier]
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the hearing of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the bearing of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising
[Chorus: Hozier & Mavis Staples]
And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Power, Lord
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power
And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power

Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power

[Verse 2: Hozier]
It's not the wall, but what's behind it
Oh, the fear of fellow man, his mere assignment
And everything that we're denied
By keeping the divide
It's not the waking, it's the rising
[Chorus: Hozier & Mavis Staples]
And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Oh, power

Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you to
Rattle your chains if you love being free

Oh, Lord, I could cry power (Power)
'Cause power is my love when my love reaches to me
James Brown cried power

Yeah ah, power

About that night, the bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging? What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me from the earth?

I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I knew that look, dear, eyes always seeking
Was there in someone that dug long ago
So I will not ask you why you were creeping
In some sad way, I already know

Words hung above but never would form
Like a cry at the final breath that is drawn
Remember me, love, when I'm reborn

All of that goodness is going with you now
Then when I met you, my virtues uncounted

Dragging along, following your form
Hung like the pelt of some prey you had worn
Remember me, love, when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn

I fled to the city with so much discounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now
Back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now

By your grounded and giving and darkening scorn
Remember me, love, when I'm reborn

I watch the work of my kin, bold and boyful
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths
Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me
[Chorus]
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
[Verse 2]
Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh
I lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet
[Chorus]
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh

In leash-less confusion, I'll wander the concrete
Wonder if better now having survived
The jarring of judgement and reason's defeat the sweet
Heat of her breath in my mouth, I'm alive
[Chorus]
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

Moment’s Silence (Common Tongue)
67 ContributorsMoment’s Silence (Common Tongue) Lyrics[Verse 1]
When stunted hand earns place with man by mere monstrosity
Alarms are struck and shore is shook by sheer atrocity
A cure I know that soothes the soul does so impossibly
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on
Me and my babe relax and catch the manic rhapsody
All reason flown as God looks on in abject apathy
A squall and all of me is a prayer in perfect piety
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me
[Chorus]
When the meaning's gone
There is clarity
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
And it's easy done
Our little remedy
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
[Verse 2]
What yields the need for those who lead us oh-so morally
Those that would view the same we do through their deformity
Who view the deed as power's creed as pure authority
This moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me
[Chorus]
Since it all begun
To its reckoning
There the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
Be thankful some know it lovingly
There the reason comes in the common tongue of your loving me

[Chorus]
Like a heathen clung to the homily
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me
So summon on the pearl rosary
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me

Would That I

True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree
A willow dancing on air before covering me
Under cotton and calicoes
Over canopy dapple long ago
[Verse 2]
True that love in withdrawal was the weepin' of me
That the sound of the saw must be known by the tree
Must be felled for to fight the cold
I fretted fire, but that was long ago
[Chorus]
And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh)
Oh, and it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
Light a fire bright (Oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)
[Verse 3]
With the roar of the fire, my heart rose to its feet
Like the ashes of ash I saw rise in the heat
Settle soft and as pure as snow
I fell in love with the fire long ago

[Verse 4]
With each love I cut loose, I was never the same
Watching still-living roots be consumed by the flame
I was fixed on your hand of gold
Layin' waste to my lovin' long ago
[Chorus]
That's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh)
Oh, and it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh)
Light the fire bright (Oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright, honey (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)
[Verse 5]
So in awe, there I stood as you licked off the grain
Though I've handled the wood, I still worship the flame
Long as amber of ember glows
All the "would that I'd loved" is long ago
[Chorus]
And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh)
Oh, and it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
Light the fire bright (Oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh)
Oh, you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, you're good to me, you're good to me (Oh, oh)

At last, when all of the world is asleep
You take in the blackness of air
The likes of a darkness so deep
That God, at the start, couldn't bear
[Verse 2]
And sit unseen with only the inner upheld
Your reflection can't offer a word
To the bliss of not knowing yourself
With all mirroring gone from the world
[Verse 3]
But, still, the mind, rejecting this new empty space
Fills it with something or someone
No closer could I be to God
Or why he would do what he's done

I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool
You're movin' without movin'
And when you move, I'm moved
You are a call to motion
There, all of you, a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean

Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
And though it's no improvement
When you move, I move
You're less Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequins
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'

Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to prove
And nothin' to lose
Move me, baby
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby, oh baby
Move like grey skies
Move like a bird of paradise
Move like an odd sight come out at night
[Chorus]
Move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothin' to prove
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

Jackie and Wilson
73 ContributorsTranslationsPolskiJackie and Wilson Lyrics[Verse 1]
So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
Soul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine
[Verse 2]
She blows out of nowhere, a roman candle of the wild
Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
And Lord, she found me just in time
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young
[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

[Verse 3]
Lord, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
We'd sit back and watch the world go by
[Pre-Chorus]
Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust
We tried the world; good God, it wasn't for us
[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues
[Instrumental]
[Verse 4]
Cut clean from the dream at night, let my mind reset
Looking up from a cigarette, she's already left
I start digging up the yard for what's left of me in our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

When I first saw you
The end was soon
To Bethlehem, it slouched
And then, must've caught a good look at you
Give your heart and soul to charity
'Cause the rest of you
The best of you
Honey, belongs to me
[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it a gentle sound, the rolling in the graves?
Ain't it like thunder under earth, the sound it makes?
Ain't it exciting you, the rumble where you lay?
Ain't you my baby, ain't you my baby?
[Chorus]
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
[Verse 2]
If I was born as a blackthorn tree
I'd wanna be felled by you
Held by you
Fuel the pyre of your enemies

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it warming you, the world gone up in flames?
Ain't it the life of you, your lighting of the blaze?
Ain't it a waste they'd watch the throwing of the shade?
Ain't you my baby, ain't you my babe?
[Chorus]
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby

Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

All the fear and the fire of the end of the world
Happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl
Happens great, happens sweet
Happily, I'm unfazed here too
[Chorus]
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
[Verse 2]
All the things yet to come are the things that have passed
Like the holding of hands, like the breaking of glass
Like the bonfire that burns that all words in the fight fell to
[Chorus]
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby

[Verse 3]
And that day that we'll watch the death of the sun
That the cloud and the cold and those jeans you'll have on
And you'll gaze unafraid as they sob from the city roofs
[Chorus]
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's wasteland, baby
[Bridge]
When the stench of the sea and the absence of green
Are the death of all things that are seen and unseen
Are the end, but the start of all things that are left to do
[Chorus]
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
[Outro]
That's it

Do you think I'd give up?
That this might've shook the love from me
Or that I was on the brink?
How could you think, darlin', I'd scare so easily?
Now that it's done
There's not one thing that I would change
My life was a storm since I was born
How could I fear any hurricane?
[Pre-Chorus]
If someone asked me at the end
[Chorus]
I'd tell them, "Put me back in it" (Da-ah, darlin')
I would do it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
If I could hold you for a minute (Da-ah, darlin')
I'd go through it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)

I would still be surprised I could find you, darlin', in any life
If I could hold you for a minute
Da-ah, darlin', I would do it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
[Verse 2]
For all that was said
Of where we'd end up at the end of it
When the heart would cease, ours nеver knew peacе
What good would it be on the far side of things?
It was too soon
When that part of you was ripped away
A grip takin' hold like a cancer that grows
Each piece of your body that it takes

[Pre-Chorus]
Though I know my heart would break
[Chorus]
I'd tell them, "Put me back in it" (Da-ah, darlin')
I would do it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)

I would still be surprised I could find you, darlin', in any life

I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love like you and I
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love like you and I
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I

To Be Alone
60 ContributorsTranslationsPolskiTo Be Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Never feel too good in crowds
With folks around when they're playing
The anthems of rape culture loud
Crude and proud, creatures baying
All I've ever done is hide
From our times when you're near me
Honey, when you kill the lights and kiss my eyes
I feel like a person for a moment of my life
[Pre-Chorus]
But you don't know what hell you put me through
To have someone kiss the skin that crawls from you
To feel your weight in arms, I'd never use
It's the God that heroin prays to
[Chorus]
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh, to be alone with you
[Refrain]
Woah, oh, oh, oh

Woah, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
There are questions I can't ask
Now, at last, the worst is over
See the way you hold yourself
Reel against your body's borders
I know that you hate this place
Not a trace of me would argue
Honey, we should run away, oh, someday
Our baby and her momma and the damaged love she made
[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't know what else that I would do
Than to try to kiss the skin that crawls from you
Than feel your weight in arms, I'd never use
It's the God that heroin prays to
[Chorus]
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good

When her body was found (Hey, yeah)
I'd be the choiceless hope in grief
That drove him underground (Hey, yeah)
I'd be the dreadful need in the devotee
That made him turn around (Hey, yeah)
And I'd be the immediate forgiveness in Eurydice
Imagine being loved by me

I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out  (Hey, yeah)

I'd be the last shred of truth
In the lost myth of true love (Hey, yeah)
I'd be the sweet feeling of release
Mankind now dreams of (Hey, yeah)
That's found in the last witness
Before the wave hits, marvelling at God (Hey, yeah)
Before he feels alone one final time and marries the sea
Imagine being loved by me

If the wind turns, if I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me
[Verse 1]
I feel lighter than I have in so much time
I've crossed the border line of weightless
One deep breath out from the sky
I've reached a rarer height now that I can confirm
All our weight is just a burden offered to us by the world
[Pre-Chorus]
And though I burn, how could I fall
When I am lifted by every word you say to me?
[Chorus]
If anything could fall at all, it's the world
That falls away from me
[Verse 2]
You have me floatin' like a feather on the sea
While you're as heavy as the world
That you hold your hands beneath
Once I wondered what was holdin' up the ground
But I can see that all along, love, it was you all the way down

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave it now, I am sky-bound
If you need to, darlin', lean your weight to me
[Chorus]
We'll float away, but if we fall
I only pray, don't fall away from me
[Bridge]
I do not have wings, love, I never will
Soarin' over a world you are carryin'
If these heights should bring my fall
Let me be your own
Icarian carrion
If the wind turns, if I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me

If I should fall on that day
I only pray, don't fall away from me

In a Week
48 ContributorsIn a Week Lyrics[Verse 1: Hozier]
I have never known peace
Like the damp grass that yields to me
I have never known hunger
Like these insects that feast on me
A thousand teeth
And yours among them, I know
Our hungers appeased
Our heartbeats becoming slow
[Pre-Chorus: Both, Karen Cowley, Hozier]
We lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found, to freeze or to thaw
So long, we'd become the flowers
Two corpses we were, two corpses I saw
[Chorus: Karen Cowley & Hozier]
And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
[Verse 2: Karen Cowley]
I have never known sleep
Like this slumber that creeps to me
I have never known colour
Like this morning reveals to me
And you haven't moved an inch
Such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this
The flesh calmly going cold

[Pre-Chorus: Karen Cowley & Hozier, Karen Cowley, Hozier]
We lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet
So long, we'd become the flowers
We'd feed well the land and worry the sheep
[Chorus: Karen Cowley & Hozier]
They'd find us in a week
When the cattle show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
[Bridge:  Karen Cowley, Hozier]
They'd find us in a week (We lay here for years or for hours)
When the weather gets hot (So long we'd become the flowers)
They'd find us in a week (We lay here for years or for hours)
When the cattle show fear (So long we'd become the flowers)
[Chorus: Karen Cowley & Hozier]
And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
[Outro: Karen Cowley & Hozier]
After the raven has had his say
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

For starts
What a waste to say the heart could feel apart
Or feel complete, baby
Why would you make out of words a cage for your own bird?
When it sings so sweet
The screaming, heaving fuckery of the world?
Why would you offer a name to the same old tired pain?
When all things come from nothing and, honey, if nothing's gained?
[Pre-Chorus]
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand
[Chorus]
There's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the reign
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again
[Verse 2]
Let it hurl, let the awful song be heard
Blue bird, I know your beat, baby
But your secret is safe with me 'cause if secrets were like seeds
Keep my body from the fire, hire a gardener for my grave
Your secret is safe with me and if secrets were like seeds
When I'm lying under marble, marvel at flowers you'll have made

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand

There's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the pain, honey, the sweeter the song
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
But I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the reign
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again
[Pre-Chorus]
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand
How big the hourglass, how deep the sand
I shouldn't hope to know, but here I stand
[Chorus]
And there's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come

A husband waits outside
A crying child pushes a child into the night
She was told he would come this time
Without leaving so much as a feather behind
To enact, at last, the perfect plan
One more sweet boy to be butchered by men
[Chorus]
But the gateway to the world
Was still outside the reach of him
Would never belong to angels
Had never belonged to man
The swan upon Leda
Empire upon Jerusalem
[Verse 2]
A grandmother smuggling meds
Past where the god-child soldier, Sétanta, stood dead
Our graceful turner of heads
Weaves through the checkpoints like a needle and thread
Someone's frightened boy waves her on
She offers a mother's smile and soon, she's gone
[Chorus]
The gateway to the world
The gun in a trembling hand
Where nature unmakes the boundary
The pillar of myth still stands
The swan upon Leda
Occupier upon ancient land

Was still outside the reach of him
Would never belong to angels

First Time

Remember once I told you about
How before I heard it from your mouth
My name would always hit my ears as such an awful sound?
And the soul, if that's what you'd call it
Uneasy ally of the body, it felt nameless as a river
Undiscovered underground
[Pre-Chorus]
And the first time that you kissed me
I drank dry the River Lethe
The Liffey would have been softer on my stomach all the same
But you spoke some quick new music
That went so far to soothe this soul
As it was and ever shall be, unearth without a name
[Chorus]
Some part of me must have died
The first time that you called me "baby"
And some part of me came alive
The first time that you called me "baby"
[Verse 2]
These days, I think I owe my life
To flowers that were left here by my mother
Ain't that like them, giftin' life to you again
This life lived mostly underground
Unknowin' either sight nor sound
Till reachin' up for sunlight just to be ripped out by the stem

[Pre-Chorus]
Sensing only now it's dyin'
Drying out, then drowning blindly
Bloomin' forth its every colour
In the moments it has left
To share the space with simple living things
Infinitely suffering, but fighting off like all creation
The absence of itself, anyway
[Chorus]
Some part of me must have died
Each time that you called me "baby"
But some part of me stayed alive
Each time that you called, each time that you called
[Bridge]
Come here
Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la
Whatever keeps you around, it keeps you around
Ooh-la-la, come here, ooh-la-la
Whatever keeps you around, it keeps you around
[Verse 3]
The last time it was heard out loud
The perfect genius of our hands and mouths were shocked
To resignation as the arguing declined
When I was young, I used to guess
Are there limits to any emptiness?
When was the last time?
Come here to me, when was the last time?

[Chorus]
Some part of me must have died
The final time that you called me "baby"
But some part of me came alive
The final time you called me "baby"

I'm afraid will always be
Trapped within an abstract from a moment of my life
The weeds up through the concrete
The traffic picking up speed
All my love and terror balanced there between those eyes

[Chorus]
See how it shines
See how it shines

Foreigner’s God
58 ContributorsTranslationsPolskiForeigner’s God Lyrics[Verse 1]
She moved with shameless wonder
The perfect creature rarely seen
Since some liar brought the thunder
When the land was godless and free
Her eyes look sharp and steady
Into the empty parts of me
Still, my heart is heavy
With the hate of some other man's beliefs
[Pre-Chorus]
Always a well-dressed fraud
Who wouldn't spare the rod
Never for me
[Chorus]
Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief
[Verse 2]
Wonderin' who I copy
Musterin' some tender charm
She feels no control of her body
She feels no safety in my arms
I've no language left to say it
But all I do is quake to her
Breakin' if I try conveying
The broken love I make to her

[Pre-Chorus]
All that I've been taught
And every word I've got
Is foreign to me
[Chorus]
Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief

Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God

Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God

Sunlight

I would shun the light, share in evening's cool and quiet
Who would trade that hum of night
For sunlight, sunlight, sunlight?
But whose heart would not take flight
Betray the moon as acolyte
On first and fierce affirming sight
Of sunlight, sunlight, sunlight?
[Chorus]
I had been lost to you, sunlight
And flew like a moth to you, sunlight, oh, sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, but it is sunlight
[Verse 2]
All the tales the same
Told before and told again
A soul that’s born in cold and rain
Knows sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
And, at last, can grant a name
To a buried and a burning flame
As love and its decisive pain
Oh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

[Chorus]
All that was shown to me, sunlight
Was somethin' foreknown to me, sunlight
Oh, sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, but it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, but it is sunlight, sunlight
[Bridge]
All these colours fade for you only
Hold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight
All these colours fade for you only
Hold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight
[Verse 3]
Each day, you'd rise with me
Know that I would gladly be
The Icarus to your certainty
Oh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Strap the wing to me
Death trap clad happily
With wax melted, I’d meet the sea
Under sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

[Chorus]
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, but it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, but it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight

As It Was

There is a roadway, muddy and foxgloved
Whenever I'd have life enough, my heart is screamin' of
And in a few days I will be there, love
Whatever here that's left of me is yours, just as it was
[Chorus]
Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark, the light, the flame
[Post-Chorus]
The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved
[Verse 2]
Tell me if, somehow, some of it remains
How long you would wait for me and how long I've been away
The shape that I'm in now, your shape in the doorway
Make your good love known to me or just tell me 'bout your day
[Chorus]
Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark, the light, the shame

[Post-Chorus]
The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved
And the sights were as stark as my baby
And the cold cut as sharp as my baby
And the nights were as dark as my baby
And half as beautiful too

Working my miracles
Holding my world together with a boot string
Living the dream
Benzos and gasoline
Coffee and blue light screens till the morning

If I tell you this is drowning
You tell me I'm walking on water
I could bring fire from the mountain
You tell me it feels a little colder
And I don't wanna

Choose between being a salesman or a soldier
Just let me look a little older
Let me step a little bolder
Choose between being a butcher or a pauper
Honey, I'm taking no orders
I'm gonna be nobody’s soldier

Sick to my skin
Watching thе news again
Whatever you choosе you lose out in the long run
The paint on the walls
Come down like a waterfall
The goal I was aiming for was the wrong one

If I say that this is drowning
You tell me I'm walking on water

All Things End

A two-tonne weight around my chest feels like
It just dropped a twenty-storey height
If there was anyone to ever get through this life
With their heart still intact, they didn't do it right
The last time I felt your weight on my chest, you said
"We didn't get it right, but, love, we did our best"
And we will again
[Pre-Chorus]
Movin' on in time and takin' more from
Everything that ends

And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
And slips right through our hands
And just knowin' that everything will end
Should not change our plans when wе begin again
[Post-Chorus]
We begin again, mm
[Verse 2]
I havе never known a silence like the one fallen here
Never watched my future darken in a single tear
I know we want this to go easy by bein' somebody's fault
But we've gone long enough to know this isn't what we want
And that isn't always bad

[Pre-Chorus]
When people say that something is forever
Either way, it ends

And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
Or slips right through our hands
And just knowin' that everything will end
Should not change our plans

And all things end (Knowin' we can always start again)
All that we intend (Knowin' we have another day)

Or slips right through our hands (Knowin' we have another day)
And just knowing (Knowing we can always start again)
That everything will end

Be

When all the worst we fear lets fall its weight
When the gyre widens on and when the wave breaks
When St. Peter loses cool and bars the gates
When Atlas acts the maggot, makes his arms shake
When the birds are heard again in their singin'
Once atrocity is hoarse from voicin’ shame
And when the earth is trembling on some new beginnin'
With the same sweet shock of when Adam first came
[Pre-Chorus]

Be like the love that discovered the sin (Lover, be good to me)
That freed the first man and will do so again
And, lover, be good to me (Lover, be good to me)
Be that hopeful feeling when Eden was lost (Lover, be good to me)
It's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed (Lover, be good to me)
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost?
Oh, lover, be good to me

[Verse 2]
When the man who gives the order
Is born next time 'round on the boat sent back
When the bodies starvin' at the border
Are on TV givin' people the sack
Oh, when the sea rises to meet us
Oh, when there's nothin' left for you and I to do
Oh, when there’s nobody upstairs to receive us
When I have no kind words left, love, for you

A joy hard learned in winter was the warming of the bed
You'd shake for minutes there and move your legs
Wrap the blanket over you and keep your head within
Let your breath heat the air until you’d feel it getting thin
[Chorus]
Uiscefhuaraithe
The feel of coldness only water brings
There are some things that no one teaches you, love
That come natural as a dream you didn't know that you were in
[Post-Chorus]
And darlin', all my dreamin’ is only put to shame
And darlin', all my dreamin' has only been given a name
But it came easy, darlin'
As natural as another leg around you in the bed frame
[Verse 2]
In summer's heat, I learned to dread the comin' of the night
The awful things we do to make the head go quiet
You'd press your body to the concrete when you were small
The rains of winter seemed to never leave the walls
[Chorus]
Uiscefhuaraithe
The feel of coolness only water brings
There are some things that no-one teaches you, love
That God in his awful wisdom first programs in

[Post-Chorus]
But darlin', all my dreamin’ is only been put to shame
And darlin’, all my dreamin' has only been given a name
But it happened easy, darlin’
As natural as another leg around you in the bed
[Bridge]
And I wish I could say
That the river of my arms have found the ocean
I wish I could say the cold lake water of my heart
Christ, it's boilin' over

But it happened easy, darlin'
Natural as another leg around you in the bed frame

My head was warm, my skin was soaked
I called your name till the fever broke
When I awoke, the moon still hung
The night, so black that the darkness hums
I raised myself, my legs were weak
I prayed my mind be good to me
An awful noise filled the air
I heard a scream in the woods somewhere
[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
A woman's voice, I quickly ran
Into the trees with empty hands
A fox, it was, he shook afraid
I spoke no words, no sound he made
His bone exposed, his hind was lame
I raised a stone to end his pain
What caused the wound? How large, the teeth?
I sure knew eyes were watchin' me
[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

The creature lunged, I turned and ran
To save a life I didn't have
Dear, in the chase, there as I flew
Forgot all prayers of joining you
I clutched my life and wished it kept
My dearest love, I'm not done yet
How many years? I know I'll bear
I found something in the woods somewhere

And I've danced real slow with Rockettes on dodgy molly

Honey, when you warm the bed on Wednesday
It's suicide Tuesday back in LA
If I had the choice between hearing either noise

At first chance, I'd take the bed warmed by the body, woo
I once warmed my hands over a burnin' Maserati, woo

Singin' at me as the first thing
How the mouth must be employed in every corner of itself
To say, "Appalacicola" or, "Hushpuckena," like, "Gweebarra"
A promise softly sung of somewhere else
[Chorus]
And as a young man blessed to pass so many road signs
And have my foreign ear made fresh again on each unlikely sound
But feel at home, hearin' a music that few still understand
A butchered tongue still singin' here above the ground

The ears were chopped from young men if the pitch cap didn't kill them
They are buried without scalp in the shattered bedrock of our home
You may never know your fortune
Until the distance has been shown between what is lost forever
And what can still be known

So far from home to have a stranger call you "darling"
And have your guarded heart be lifted like a child up by the hand
In some town that just means "home" to them
With no translator left to sound
A butchered tongue still singin' here above the ground

Rushing to shore to meet her
Foaming with loneliness
White hands to fondle and beat her
Give her his onliness

42 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschPortuguêsУкраїнськаFirst Light Lyrics[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
[Verse 1]
One bright mornin' changes all things
Soft and easy as your breathin', you wake
Your eyes open at first, a thousand miles away
But turnin' shoot a silver bullet point-blank range
And I can scarce believe what I'm believin' in
Could this be how every day begins?
[Pre-Chorus]
The sky set to burst, the gold and the rust
The colour erupts
You fillin' my cup, the sun comin' up
[Chorus]
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes)
Like I lived my whole life
Bеfore the first light
(Some bright mornin')

[Verse 2]
Onе bright mornin' goes so easy
Darkness always finds you either way
It creeps into the corners as the moment fades
A voice your body jumps to callin' out your name
But after this, I'm never gonna be the same
And I am never going back again
[Pre-Chorus]
The sky set to burst, the gold and the rust
The colour erupts
You fillin' my cup, the sun comin' up
[Chorus]
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes)
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin')
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes), yeah
Yeah, like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes), yeah, yeah
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes)

Through Me (The Flood)
35 ContributorsTranslationsУкраїнськаThrough Me (The Flood) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Picture a man
Seen like a speck out from the shore
Swimming out beyond the breakers
Like he's done his life before
He feels a coming of a squall
Will drag him out a greater length
But knows his strength and tries to gather it
[Verse 2]
And he swims on
Turning back to shore again
Above the outer atmosphere
Of a world he's never seen
And looking down to his new home
He feels the rising of a wave and knows at once
He will not weather it
[Pre-Chorus]
Like that man
I lookеd down into the depths when I mеt you
I couldn't measure it
[Chorus]
Anytime I'd struggled on
Against the course out on my own
Every time I'd burn through the world, I'd see
That the world, it burns through me
But when I (When I), I'd let go (I'd let go)
My struggling form (My struggling form), my willing soul (I'd see)
Every time (Each time I) would flow through the world, I'd see (Flow through the)
That the world (The world), it flows through me (It flows through me)
That the world, it flows through me

[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Picture a grave
Picture six feet freshly dug
The sharp temporary walls
At the long-term cliff edge of the world
Light and air find some new deepness there
And usher down the sky
Where one stands by and tries make sense of it
[Verse 4]
But try measure loss
Measure the silence of a house
The unheard footsteps at the doorway
The unemployment of the mouth
The waking up, having forgotten
And remembering again the full extent
Of what forever is
[Pre-Chorus]
With each grave
I think of loss and I can only think of you
And I couldn't measure it
[Chorus]
Anytime I've struggled on (When I struggled on)
Against the course (Against the course) out on my own (I'd see)
Every time (Each time I) I'd burn through the world, I'd see (Burn through the)
That the world (The world), it burns through me (It burns through me)
But when I (When I), I'd let go (I'd let go)
My struggling form (My struggling form), my willing soul (I'd see)
Every time (Each time I) would flow through the world, I'd see (Flow through the)
That the world (The world), it flows through me (It flows through me)
That the world, it flows through me

Fare Well

I, I wouldn't fare well
And I, I couldn't fare well
Hedgehog-under-a-van-wheel kind of wouldn't fare well
Out here tryin' to feel good again
And I, I wouldn't fare well
A kitten-cosy-in-the-engine type of wouldn't fare well
A dog-deep-into-the-chocolate kind of wouldn't fare well
Out here tryin' to feel good again

I'll take any high
Any glazin' of the eyes
Any solitary pleasure that was sorrow in disguise
Let the sun only shine on me through a fallin' sky
I'll be alright
[Post-Chorus]
Joy, disaster, come unbound here
I'll deny me none while I'm allowed
With all things above the ground
[Verse 2]
And I, I wouldn't fare well
A whale-swimmin'-up-Sumida-Gawa wouldn't fare well
Critic-hopin'-to-be-remembered wouldn't fare well

To Noise Making (Sing)
55 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoTo Noise Making (Sing) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Remember when you'd sing just for the fuck of it?
Any joy it would bring, honey, the look of it
Was as sweet as the sound
Your head tilt back, your funny mouth to the clouds
I couldn't hope to know that song or know its words
Wouldn't claim to feel the same we felt the first time it was heard
I couldn't name that feeling carried in that voice
Was it that or just the act of makin' noise that brought you joy?
[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to sing it right
But who could call you wrong?
To put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice but, honey, sing it strong
At best, you'll find a little remedy
At worst, the world will sing along
[Chorus]
So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
[Verse 2]
Remember when you'd sing before we'd move to it?
And we'd scuff up our shoes
Honey, the groove of it was whatever you choose
"I Wanna Be Your Lover" or "The Fisherman's Blues"

[Pre-Chorus]
You didn't always sing it right
But who could call you wrong?
To put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice but, honey, sing it strong
At best, you'll find a little remedy
At worst, the world will sing along
[Chorus]
So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
[Bridge]
Who could ask you be unbroken or be brave again?
Or, honey, hope even on this side of the grave again
And who could ask you to be sound or to feel saved again?
But stick around until you hear that music play again
[Chorus]
So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing (Remember when you'd sing just for the love of it?)
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing (Just for the love of it)
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing

Remember when you'd sing just for the love of it?

Anything But
43 ContributorsTranslationsУкраїнськаDeutschPortuguêsAnything But Lyrics[Verse 1]
Come here to me, I wish I was a may fly on the River Tay
I'd fit all my joys and my pleasures in one perfect day
I wish I was the sunlight just sitting on The Mississippi
I'd settle for a shopping trolley in The Liffey
In a shot, I'd swap my body for a body of water
Worry the cliff side top as a wave crashing over
I'd lower the world in a flood or, better yet, I'd cause a drought
If I was a riptide, I wouldn't take you out
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be anything
But I would do everything just to run away
I don't wanna be anything like this at all
But I would do everything if you'd hear me say
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah, hey
Go look anothеr way
Yeah, hey
Look another way
[Verse 2]
Look, I wanna bе loud, so loud, I'm talking seismic
I wanna be soft as a single stone in a rainstick
I wanna be the thunder of a hundred thousand hooves moving quick
If I was a stampede, you wouldn't get a kick
I wanna be the shadow when my bright future's behind me
I wanna be the last thing anybody ever sees
I hear he touches your hand and then you fly away together
If I had his job, you would live forever

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be anything, love
But I would do everything just to run away
I don't wanna be anything like this at all
But I would do everything if you hear me say
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah, hey
Go look another way
Yeah, hey
Look another way
[Bridge]
I don't wanna be anything, be anything
But I would do everything (Go look another way)
I don't wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be
Don't wanna be anything, anything
[Outro]
Oh, yeah, hey
Go look another way (I don't wanna be anything)
Yeah, hey
Look another way

You tell me the sun is shining in paradise
And I have to watch your lips turn blue

That You Are

One, two, three
[Verse 1: Hozier]
It's the sound of it that brings me there
This city locked into the song of prayer
That finds no melody
Every moment of the working day
The twitching muscles in each step I take
The prayer is all of me
[Chorus: Hozier & Bedouine]
That I'd be
Anywhere that you are, that you are
That I'd be
Anywhere that you are, that you are
[Verse 2: Bedouine]
Maybe I have yet to venture out
See the places that I hear about
Planes and trains and cars
Carve their lines into a curve like blades
All I get to are mistakes half-made
Leave the door ajar
[Chorus: Hozier & Bedouine]
But I'd be
Anywhere that you are, that you are
That I'd be
Anywhere that you are, you are

[Instrumental Interlude]
[Bridge: Hozier & Bedouine]
The prayer
Is all of me, all of me
The prayer
Is all of me, all of me

Anywhere that you are, that you are

July

Winter wore me out like I was Prada
Threw up on me when the night was through
You can keep a dream in your mind
Only to find it's the hope that was killing you
[Pre-Chorus]
But you arrived like sunlight in the gloom
And burned off the haze when the year was still new
[Chorus]
Keeping me going how you show up
Like July, July
And July is still coming
It's made real by the things that you do
July, July
And July is still coming
Just knowing that's getting me through
[Verse 2]
And you can go to work, until your disaster, babe
Build your temple to sound and stone
Put in all of that time, only to find
By the end that your god has flown
[Pre-Chorus]
Or all alone, he sank like a stone
Took root where he fell and started to grow

[Chorus]
Blooming beyond us like the promise of July, July
And July is still coming
It's made real by the things that you do
And July, July
And July is still coming
Just knowing that's getting me through
July, July
And July is still coming
It's made real by the things that you do
And July, July
And July is still coming
Just knowing that's getting me through
[Instrumental Bridge]

And July is still coming
It's made real by the things you do

Better Love
24 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeFrançaisBetter Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I once kneeled in shaking thrill
I chase the memory of it still
Of every chill
Chided by the silence of the hushed sublime
Blind to the purpose of the brute divine
But you were mine
Staring into blackness at some distant star
The thrill of knowing how alone we are
Unknown we are
To the world and to the both of us
I confessed a longing I was dreaming of
Some better love
[Chorus]
But there's no better you love
That beckons above me
There's no better love
That ever has loved me
There's no better love
Darling, feel better love
Feel better love

[Verse 2]
I have never loved a darker blue
Then the darkness I have known in you
Honed from you
You whose heart would sing in anarchy
You who'd laugh at meanings guarantees
So beautifully
When our truth is burned from history
By those who figure justice in fond memory
Witness me
Like fire weeping from a cedar tree
Know that my love would burn with me
Or live eternally
[Chorus]
'Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me
There's no better love
That ever has loved me
There's no better love
So darling, feel better love
'Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me
There's no better love
That justifies me
There's no better love
So darling, darling, feel better love
Feel better love

[Bridge]
Feel better love
Feel better love
Feel better love
[Chorus]
'Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me
There's no better love
That ever has loved me
There's no better love
So darling, feel better love
'Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me
There's no better love
That justifies me
There's no better love
So darling, feel better love
Feel better love

Be, be as you've always been
Be like the love that discovered the sin
That freed the first man and will do so again
And, lover, be good to me
Be that hope when Eden was lost
It's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost?
And, lover, be good to me

Be as you've always been
Be as you've always been

Be, be as you've always been
True to the time and the placе you've been given
Your heart in thе world, and a world there within
And, lover, be good to me
Be there and just as you stand
Or be like the rose that you'd hold in your hand
That grows bold in a barren and an uneasy land
And, lover, be good to me

And, be as you've always been
Be as you've always been
Be as you've always been

Blood

Tryin' hard to recognise
Some pure motive inside of me
A creature that would horrify
Any child that I used to be
Oh, give no faith to show
Started to smile so I showed my teeth
No more than flesh and bone
Doin' so much just to watch someone bleed
[Chorus]
But I love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always
[Verse 2]
Tryin' hard, I nearly find
Innocence in spite of me
Oh, creature that would terrify
Any child left inside of me
Oh, that's a cold insight
Nothin' above us and nothin' below
Ahh, but you might be right
If there is no heaven and there is no soul

[Chorus]
I just love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always
Always, always, always
Oh, I love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always
Oh, I love the very blood of you
Leaks and squeeks you black and blue
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always

Any other day, I would call, you would say
"Baby, how's your day?"
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "uh-huh". “yeah ok"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
That I am not the one to sit around, and be played
So prove yourself to me, I'm the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

But the Wages
14 ContributorsBut the Wages Lyrics[Verse 1]
Although many contend
You can find hope ascend
To mark just how everything changes
Be it the temperature highs
Or the sea level rising
It's all going up but the wages
And murdered reporters
And talk of hard borders
Sky-bound as a heavenly choir
Or the stock price in Boeing
The screams of the dying
Or the skies over Yemen last night
[Chorus]
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
[Verse 2]
Don't mention the rent
Or the money that's spent
Keeping the banks in good health
Or ridiculous claims
Or the level of blame
Pointed to anything else

And preachy musicians
And those stuck in prisons
For scarcely enough for a blunt
Or the pressure of blood
That new hotel in the hood
With an oligarch's name on the front
[Chorus]
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up with the bump in the heating bills
Even though the city's on fire
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
[Bridge]
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

[Chorus]
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up with the bump in the heating bills
Even though the city's on fire
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time

Take Me To Church (One World: Together At Home)
4 ContributorsTake Me To Church (One World: Together At Home) Lyrics[Verse 1]
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
[Pre-Chorus]
Amen, amen
Amen, amen
[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work
[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life
[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, amen
Amen, amen
[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life

The Love Of
3 ContributorsThe Love Of Lyrics[Chorus]
If towers fall, if nothing stands
I’ll build again the world by my baby’s hands
At the end of all, there’s all they claim and then
[Verse 1]
I saw the news again
To hear that the world’s to end in flames
I’d not complain, I’ve seen the love of my baby
Be on the take, or talkin’ of slaughter over cake
Would kneel and break
Speak of the love of my baby
[Chorus]
If towers fall, if nothing stands
I’ll build again the world by my baby’s hands
At the end of all, there’s all they claim and then
[Verse 2]
The angels can know their place
Let heaven hidе its face in sheer disgrace
Oh, look upon the lovе of my baby
Those who wield the chain
Are pushing the wheels of fear and shame
Forget their name
Hear of the love, the love, the love

[Chorus]
If towers fall, if nothings stands
I’d build again the world by my baby’s hands
The unamable, the unmade again
And then
[Bridge]
So hurry up and start
Can’t wait for the world to fall apart
‘Cus here unmarked
Would still be the love, the love, the love

Rob The Goddess
2 ContributorsRob The Goddess LyricsLyrics From Snippet : Please Do Not Edit Using The Asmodeus Leak As It Is Not Confirmed By Hozier Or Teased By Him

…Made right
By the hope that She affords me
As She’s lifting spring towards me
Like a baby in her hands
Back on ground
The thought arriving with her;
No mere saint makes shit of winter
Here or any land
And of all times, I won’t lie
If she can pull it off just one more year
I swear, the old demotion be damned
I will not rob the goddess
I will not rob the goddess
One more prayer

My Lagan Love
4 ContributorsMy Lagan Love LyricsWhere Lagan stream sings lullaby
There blows a lily fair
The twilight gleam is in her eye
The night is on her hair
And like a love-sick lennan-shee
She has my heart in thrall
Nor life I owe nor liberty
For love is lord of all
And often when the beetle's horn
Hath lulled the eve to sleep
I steal unto her shieling lorn
And thru the dorring peep
There on thy cricket's singing stone
She spares the bogwood fire
And hums in sad sweet undertone
The songs of heart's desire
Her welcome, like her love for me
Is from her heart within
Her warm kiss is felicity
That knows no taint of sin
And when I stir my soot to go
'Tis leaving love and light
To feel the wind of longing blow
From out the dark of night

I Could Be Yours
4 ContributorsI Could Be Yours LyricsI could be soft and sweet
I could be hard and loud
I could be anything
You'd ever need somehow
Why don't you hear me sing out from the lost and found
I could be yours
I could be yours
I could be yours
Why don't you try on me
Why don't you take me home
I'll match the color scheme of your bedroom walls
Oh, take a dose of me
It doesn't hurt at all
I could be yours
I could be yours
I could be yours
Oh God, I'd benefit
From your sweet tenderness
Thank God, it could have been
'cause nothing comes from it
That'd be a helpful thought
If I could remember it, but
I could be yours
I could be yours
I could be yours

Too Sweet (Beekeeping Version)
3 ContributorsToo Sweet (Beekeeping Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's 10 o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep tellin' me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby, now and then
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you just wanna wake up
Dark as a lake
Smellin' like a bonfire
Lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe
I think it's great
But while in this world
[Chorus]
I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me

[Non-Lyrical Vocals]
[Verse 2]
I aim low
I aim true, and the ground's where I go
I work late where I'm free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some, I know
But who wants to live forever, babe?
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest of you like you're the TSA
I wish I could go along
Babe, don't get me wrong
[Pre-Chorus]
You know you're bright as the morning
As soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine
As sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel
Maybe I'll wait
Until that day
[Chorus]
I'd rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me

Humours of Whiskey
5 ContributorsHumours of Whiskey LyricsCome guess me this riddle, what beats pipe and fiddle
What's hotter than mustard and milder than cream
What best wets your whistle, what's clearer than crystal
Sweeter than honey and stronger than steam
What can make the dumb talk, what can make the lame walk
What's the elixir of life and philosopher's stone
And what helped Mr. Brunnell to dig the Thames Tunnel
Sure wasn't it whiskey from old Inis Eoghain
So we'll stick to the cratur the best thing in nature
For sinkin' your sorrows and raisin' your joys
And boys I half wondеr if lighting and thunder
Was made from the plundеr of whiskey me boys

Young Americans
6 ContributorsYoung Americans LyricsThey pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"gee my life's a funny thing, am i still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but
(she)
All night
She wants the young american
Young american, young american, she wants the young american
All right
She wants the young american
Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her ford mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries "where have all papa's heroes gone?"
(she)
All the way from washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
"we live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?"
(he)
All night
He wants the young american
Young american, young american, he wants the young american
All right
He wants the young american
Do you remember, your president nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay
Or even yesterday?
Have you have been an un-american?
Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-sheilas
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you have
(you)
All night
You want the young american
Young american, young american, you want the young american
All right
You want the young american
You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a cadi and a lady got a chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(i heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man you can say no more?
And, ain't there a woman i can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child i can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me
Break down and cry?
(i) (repeat 3 times)
All night
I want the young american
Young american, young american, i want the young american
All right
I want the young american

I will stroll the merry way and jump the hedges first
I will drink clear clean water for to quench my thirst
I'll go watch the ferry boats and I'll get high
On the bluer ocean against the water's sky

Hey it's me tonight I'm dynamite and I don't know why

And I shall never, ever, ever grow so cold again

I shall raise my hand up into the night, to the night sky
And count the stars that are shinin' in your eye
Just to dig it all and not to wonder that would be fine
You're satisfied not to read in between the lines

Ooh, good God, you're a sweet thing
Ooh, good God, you're a sweet thing
Ooh, my, my, my, my, my sweet thing

And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water

When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'm on your side, when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh, if you ever need a friend
I'm sailing behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water

Let me wrap my teeth around the world
Start carvin', darlin'
I wanna smell the dinner cookin'
I wanna feel the edges start to burn

Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw еnough rope until the legs havе swung

I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool

Or Fred Astaire in sequins
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved

That just means he didn't call or vice versa
That depends on wherever you're at
Or and if you never hear from me
That just means I would rather not

I heard stories of a love supreme
Like a distant dream
Dreams are falling always end in a waking scream
Took part waiting for my life to start
To believe my heart had a use beyond keeping up cold routines
Move me, baby, like a willow tree
Won't you stay with me, woah, to make my life complete?
Oh, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
If you only knew
Mine forever, you'd be lost to my love supreme

Each day feeling something fall away
How can I explain what it is to be saved by a love supreme?
Like death, the sweet release with no regret
Only better yet, wake up alive in the arms of your love supreme

[Intro]
Oh yeah
Mmm-yeah
[Verse 1]
Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange ch-ch-changes)
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange ch-ch-changes)
Ch-ch-changes, just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
Though the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through
[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange ch-ch-changes)
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange ch-ch-changes)
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
[Bridge]
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Ah, changes are taking the pace I'm going through
[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange ch-ch-changes)
Look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange ch-ch-changes)
Soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

Ask me again when "I want more" ends
Honey, they're wavin' that flag again
And Lord, they're calling the desperate men
Cryin' out "war is peace, let the dogs off the leash"
Who'll be the stick when the drum gets beat?
I broke before hitting skin or sheet
That noise and shape of you in the street
Honey, you weren't known to be discreet
You weren't known to be discreet

Lord, how many ears have heard the lie? (Do-do-do-do-do)
How many worse off than you and I? (Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)

Just to wake and find you'd kissed my eyes (Ooh)
Honey, I've died as many times (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
[Verse 2]
We'll be asked who knew all along
Who spoke out or who wrote a song
For fear of coming on too strong
Honey, most were known to be discreet
What did anyone really care?
For the next one they lost in there
For fear we'd upset the market share
Honey, most were known to be discreet
Most were known to be discreet

Lord, how many ears have heard the lie? (Do-do-do-do-do)
How many worse off than you and I? (Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)

[Bridge]
When we met on the street, you were mid-road
Ah, when will you know, Lord, to be discreet
To your place where you bled out the radio
Ah, when will you know, Lord, to be discreet
Mock the man as he sang you falsetto
Ah, when will you know, Lord, to be discreet
Our love being made from a window
Ah, when will you know, Lord, to be discreet
[Chorus]
How many ears have heard the lie? (Do-do-do-do-do)
How many worse off than you and I? (Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)

Just to wake and find you'd kissed my eyes (Ooh)

When the boy in the squats said ‘Oh pass the mic,’
Bartender give him liquor [?]
They’re around me for my [?] tryna pick me up
Switch it up
Take a whiff
Get a nose full
When you smell it can’t you tell it’s so soulful
Can’t you see I’m up to no good
I’m so bad I make it seem so good
My boys will make them blush
Can tell I want your number but your number ain’t enough
This one for the world turning at the cusp so heading for the telephone now I’m in a rush
You and I won’t dream we live in Rio
Whatever you desire [?]
How I feel right now
Oh baby I’m on fire

Got the people like hold up that’s hip hop
It’s hot
Can’t tell me that it’s not
Changing the game to [?] a man’s [?]
He ain’t gotta spend a couple grand on a wristwatch
To tell you what time it is
I’m the rapper with the most
They ain’t even close
I propose a toast to all of you who gross
We ain’t even in the same boat
I’m here wishing on a fallen star
And I quote, ‘I ain't driving in a [?] car’
I know a lot of people though
Communist [?]
Always on the scene and you know I get it [?]
Always in the way that’s who I’m gunning for
They see me coming and they know what I’m coming for
You and I won’t dream we live in Rio
Whatever you desire [?]
How I feel right now
Oh baby I’m on fire
So now you [?]
Opening doors well they say I’m passing go
So passionate
Going [?] I never would’ve imagined it
Exotic girls got no problem bagging it
My music attracts them it’s like a magnet

Greater Worth
2 ContributorsGreater Worth Lyrics[Verse]
Oh, I feel
But I feel I’m losing you
Feeling’s worse than thinking these days
I think of only all that I didn’t do
Or what I did to have you driven away
[Chorus]
But it don’t matter if you count your bad dreams
‘Cause they each feel as real as the first
I dream my skin—it crawls away from me
Towards a man of much greater worth
[Verse]
Good God, it’s still so new to me
You turned the heavy rock that night
No one’s ever
Honey, been so kind to me
Let me adjust in this light
[Chorus]
But I’m a mess, so you can bet your life
I will kill everything I love
Well, I feel my skin crawling away from me
In search of a man of some greater worth

[Verse]
How long ‘til you crawl away from me?
‘Til I forget how you fеlt
How long until someone new doеs what you do for me?
Before they find out I’m not someone else
[Chorus]
Meanwhile I’m trapped here with the man I’ll be
‘Til they put me in the earth
At last, my skin can crawl away from me
Towards a world of much greater worth

Nina Cried Power (Black Box Sessions - Indie88)
2 ContributorsNina Cried Power (Black Box Sessions - Indie88) Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoeing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising
[Verse 2]
It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising
[Verse 3]
It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the hearing of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the baring of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising
[Chorus]
I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, lord
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, lord
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power

[Verse 4]
It’s not what’s in front but who’s beside you
It’s all that came before and what it provides you
All those that held the line
Who wouldn’t bow down and resign
It’s not the waking, it’s the rising
[Chorus: Hozier and Mavis Staples]
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, lord
Nina cried power
James Brown cried power
Lennon cried power
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Ah (Power, lord)
Joni cried power
Julie cried power
Nina cried power
[Bridge]
And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you
To rattle your chains if you love being free (power)

[Outro]
And I could cry power (power)
Power is my love when my love reaches to me (power, love)
James Brown cried power
Curtis cried power
Marvin cried power
Ah, power (power)
Power (power)
(Power, love)
Nina cried power, power, power
Nina cried power

Take Me to Church / Techno Party (Sam Collins & TWINSICK Edit) [Mixed]
5 ContributorsTake Me to Church / Techno Party (Sam Collins & TWINSICK Edit) [Mixed] Lyrics[Verse: Hozier]
My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I shoulda worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
[Chorus: Hozier]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer mе that deathless death
Oh, good God, lеt me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
[Post-Chorus: Hozier, Calvin Harris]
Take me to church
When I met you in the summer
Take me to church
When I met you in the summer

[Build: Hozier]
Take me to church
Take me to church
[Drop: Hozier]
Take me to church
Ain't no party like a techno party

Hozier - To Someone From A Warm Climate (Traducción al español)
1 ContributorHozier - To Someone From A Warm Climate (Traducción al español) Lyrics[Verso 1]
Una alegría que se aprendió duramente en invierno, fue el calentamiento de la cama.
Allí temblabas, durante minutos y movías las piernas.
Envuélvete con la manta y mantén la cabeza dentro.
Deja que tu aliento caliente el aire hasta que sientas que adelgaza.
[Coro]
Uiscefhuaraithe
La sensación de frescura que sólo el agua trae.
Hay algunas cosas que nadie te enseña, amor.
Eso viene natural como un sueño en el que no sabías que te encontrabas.
[Post-Estribillo]
Y cariño, todos mis sueños sólo han sido avergonzados.
Y cariño, a todos mis sueños solo les ha dado un nombre.
Pero fue fácil, cariño,
Tan natural como otra pierna a tu alrededor en el marco de la cama.
[Verso 2]
En el calor del verano, aprendí a temer la llegada de la noche.
Las cosas horribles que hacemos para calmar la cabeza.
Presionabas tu cuerpo contra el concreto cuando eras pequeño.
Las lluvias del invierno parecían no abandonar nunca las paredes.
[Coro]
Uiscefhuaraithe
La sensación de frescura que sólo el agua trae.
Hay algunas cosas que nadie te enseña, amor.
Que Dios en su terrible sabiduría primero programa.

[Post-Estribillo]
Pero cariño, todos mis sueños sólo han sido avergonzados.
Y cariño, a todos mis sueños solo les ha dado un nombre
Pero sucedió tan fácil, cariño,
Tan natural como otra pierna a tu alrededor en la cama.
[Puente]
Y desearía poder decir
Que el río de mis brazos ha encontrado el océano.
Ojalá pudiera decir el agua fría del lago de mi corazón,
Cristo, se está desbordando.
[Outro]
Pero sucedió fácil, cariño,
Natural como otra pierna a tu alrededor en el marco de la cama.
